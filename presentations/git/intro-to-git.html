<aside class="notes">
<p>
Git is a version control system, It allows you to version your code simply and
effectively as well as providing interfaces to look through and edit these
versions.

<h2 id="org82e72ef">Why use git</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
For large systems you need to have the ability to know where code comes from.
The ability to collaborate on the system and see who wrote lines of code.
Git provides tools for this in one cohesive package as well as many more to
manage your code and any other plain text files you may have.
</p>

<p>
In essenence its the automatic version of this process
</p>

<p>
Its also the industry standard :shrug:

<aside class="notes">
<p>
A repository is a folder that git tracks. This almost always be a project of
some kind.

<h3 id="org2fefb36">Commit</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
A commit is a set of changes that is saved to the history, this is the building
block of many other constructs of git.
</p>

<section id="slide-org59acae0">
<h3 id="org59acae0">Branch</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
A branch is a set of commits. commits themselves have parent commits that form
links, when two commits have the same parent they form a new &ldquo;branch&rdquo;. this
Branch is seperate from the main and two or more can exist in the same repo,
this is the way we usually introduce bigger changes into a code base
</p>

<p>
the idea is, to branch off main, make a bunch of commits, then merge the change
back

<aside class="notes">
<p>
A pull request is a request sent to a repositiory to <i>pull</i> in the changes
someone has made.
</p>

<p>
Back in the day this was an email. Today github has cooped this terminolgy for
its interface of making changes

<h2 id="orge92c338">Cloning a repository</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Now lets begin with the first way to start a repo, to clone someone elses work!
</p>

<p>
to do this we use the git clone commmand!
</p>

<p>
Lets discuss the anatomy of this, this is not an intro to the unix shell, thats
another workshop.
</p>

<p>
Discuss the overall structure of a git command <code>Super-M-d</code>
</p>
<ul>
<li>the first part is the command</li>
<li>the second is the sub command, this is how you tell git to do something
specific in this case clone.</li>
<li>Third is the location of the repository</li>
<li>You can give a fourth thing which is the path to clone into, otherwise it will
clone it into a new folder branching off the current one</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="org5aee719">git status</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Lets check the status of our current repo,
It gives us the info about the head and whatever changes exist

<h3 id="org48128ce">git log</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
git log is the way we access the history of a git repo. It contains all the info
about all the commits. Its how we familerise ourselves with what is going on
</p>

<section id="slide-org7678b15">
<h2 id="org7678b15">What is a commit</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
As hinted too before a commit is a set of changes saved to the afformentioned
history. To create one we must first stage a change
</p>

</aside>
</section>
<section id="slide-orgdc9a1eb">
<h3 id="orgdc9a1eb">Staging</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Before we can commit changes we must stage them, to do this we use the git add
command.
If we want to unstage a change we can use the
git restore &#x2013;staged file
note that without the restore you will delete the changes, from the file, this
can sometimes be wanted but not always, be careful
</p>

<p>
The question arises, why do we stage? In a lot of cases it seems silly, but when
we have multiple changes we are working con courrently it makes sense only to
stage the changes that are related to each other.
</p>

<p>
This feeds into the idea that commits should only really contain one change. To
include everything is bad form and leads to an unreadable history.
</p>

<h3 id="org3c4cebf">Commiting</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
we have now staged the changes lets commit them. Its a simple matter of calling
git commit.
</p>

<p>
This will open up an editor, where you can write out a commit message, to finish
you save the file and close the editor.
</p>

<p>
If you only plan on writing one line you can add the message inline. you can add
the -m flag.

<h2 id="org5f8fd19">Writing good commits</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Note now the commit message may seem like a box to tick, but its important if
you plan on reading the history back.
This is why standards such as conventional commits exist. They semantically link
commits together by what they are changing.
</p>

<p>
show examples of shitty and good hisories

<h3 id="orgf9258f2">Switching</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
To switch to a new branch we use the git branch command.
We are now in an alternate timeline, anything we commit here will not affect
other branches, we can merge them back in later if we so wish too.
</p>

<p>
This should be used whenever you are doing a large change, for example a feature
implementation. They are cheap to make so do not worry about making hundreds

<aside class="notes">
<p>
we have created the branch but now we need to chekc it out. for that we use the
checkout command
</p>

Usually we git branch
then git checkout,

this is so common git has a short hand
