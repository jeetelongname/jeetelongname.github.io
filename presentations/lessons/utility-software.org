* What is utility software?
#+begin_notes
Its a collection of programs that does some kind of maintenance task, most
computers come with some kind of utility software to keep the computer
maintained

** Encryption software
#+begin_notes
most modern operating systems contain some kind of encryption software too make
sure users can't access un authorised files.

encryption software scrambles a file into cipher text which can then be
reconstructed by the user when some secret key is provided.

some examples of encryption software is gpg on linux, bitlocker on Windows and
file vault on macos, these systems automatically decrypt files usually on login
so the user does not even need to think about it.

This is very important for laptops as they can be easily stolen which leads can
lead to data breaches and all the fun things that entails (see the GDPR laws)

** Defragmentation software
#+begin_notes
Defragmentation software has been discussed but usually comes with the OS,
essentially it brings blocks of data that have been separated by just general use
closer together to improve read and write performance

its important to note that users should not defragment an ssd as it has no
benefits and causes unnecessary read and write operations degrading the disk
#+end_notes
** Data Compression
#+begin_notes
Data compression is the act of making files smaller through some process, there
are 2 types, lossy and lossless, the latter shrinking destructively and the
former using algorithms which can then be used to expand the file back out.
