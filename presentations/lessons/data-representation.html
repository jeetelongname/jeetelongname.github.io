<h2 id="orgf3ddf45">Data Storage and Representation</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
All data on a computer is stored in binary, sets of 0&rsquo;s and 1&rsquo;s.
this is because a computer uses electrical signals to do its processing so you
can only have on or off.

<h3 id="orgf631c72">Characters</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
characters are represented using codes, more formally ascii codes.
essentially a number is assigned to a character and when that character is come
across the computer knows to replace that code with the symbol or character
<a href="https://www.asciitable.com/">https://www.asciitable.com/</a>
</p>

<p>
note that the amount of characters available is limited by the amount of bits
available, back when the standard was written it used 7 bits so only 128
characters could be represented. this was ok for a while but then some new
symbols were needed so another bit was added (making a total of 8 bits) which
brought the around of symbols that could be represented to 256.
</p>

<p>
In your exam your character codes will use 8 bits this can also be represented
in hexadecimal. so for example 6A represents lowercase j and 4A is uppercase J
</p>

<section id="slide-org0ba9520">
<h4 id="org0ba9520">Unicode</h4>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Unicode can use anything from 8 bits to 32 bits, so it can represent characters
from languages from all around the world and then some.
</p>

<p>
Its a common encoding used on the web and used by organizations where they need
to communicate in many different languages.
</p>

<p>
Some of the disadvantages include that it will take up more size if you use a
language that is not english
</p>

<h3 id="org0aaf5e8">Images</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Images can be represented 2 ways, either as a set of pixels or as a set of
mathematically equations which can then be rendered. these are called bitmaps
and vectors respectfully
</p>

<p>
There are 2 factors when it comes to image quality, the colour depth and the
resolution of the image.
</p>

</aside>

</section>
<section id="slide-orga1df4de">
<h4 id="orga1df4de">Vector images</h4>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
a vector image is a set of shapes and lines which use coordinates and equations
to represent an image. this has the nice benift of having the ability to scale
to any size without loosing quality, with the downside being it does not capture
as much detail (as natural things are harder to represent using a mathamatical formula)
</p>

</aside>

</section>
<section id="slide-org9cefd52">
<h4 id="org9cefd52">Colour Depth</h4>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Colour depth is the measure of the amount of colours a pixel can represent. as
there are three sub pixels and each has a set of bits.
</p>

<p>
lets forget about other colours
if there is a one bit depth that means you can 2 colours
If there is a 2 bit depth then there are 4 colours
you can work out the amount of colours for one pixel by raising 2 to the power
to the number of bits.
2<sup>1</sup> is 2 and 2<sup>3</sup> = 8
you cna then multiply this by three to work out the amount of colours with three
sub pixels
</p>

<p>
in your exam you will be using 8 bit colour, this means each pixel will have 256
colour combinations
</p>

<p>
In other words colour depths means how many colours per pixel
</p>

</aside>
</section>
<section id="slide-org76e7937">
<h4 id="org76e7937">Resolution</h4>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Resolution is a lot easier to understand. It is the density of pixels. measured
in pixel per inch. the higher the PPI the more detailed it will be but also the
more space it will take up.
</p>

<section id="slide-org29343d1">
<h4 id="org29343d1">Metadata</h4>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Metadata is data about the data (about the image.) Its used to make the jobs of
other programs (and the viewer easier)
things that can be metadata can include
</p>
<ul>
<li>the file format (.jpg, .png &#x2026;)</li>
<li>the dimensions</li>
<li>the resolution</li>
<li>the colour depth</li>
<li>a time stamp</li>
<li>settings when the photo was taken</li>
<li>maybe the location</li>

<h3 id="org67b484c">Sound</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
sound has two metrics the sampling rate, the duration and the bit depth.
</p>

</aside>
</section>
<section id="slide-org1ea26a0">
<h4 id="org1ea26a0">Sampling rate</h4>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
the sampling rate is how many times per second is a measurement is taken. <b>use
board</b>
</p>

</aside>
</section>
<section id="slide-org3ce6566">
<h4 id="org3ce6566">Bit rate</h4>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Bit rate is the size of the sample. the higher the number the higher the high
notes you can capture.
</p>

<p>
this does mean that the higher bit rate will lead to a higher sound quality but
also does means a larger file size.
</p>

</aside>
</section>
<section id="slide-orgb5303a9">
<h4 id="orgb5303a9">Calculating the size of a file</h4>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
You can calculate the bitrate by multiplying the sample rate (the amount of
samples) with the bit depth (the size of each sample).
</p>

<p>
you can then multiply is with the duration (in seconds) to work out the file
size
