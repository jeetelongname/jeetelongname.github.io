* Sound
#+begin_notes
sound has two metrics the sampling rate, the duration and the bit depth.
#+end_notes
** Sampling rate
#+begin_notes
the sampling rate is how many times per second is a measurement is taken. *use
board*
#+end_notes
** Bit depth
#+begin_notes
Bit detph is the size of each sample
#+end_notes
** Bit rate
#+begin_notes
Bit rate is the size of the sample. the higher the number the higher the high
notes you can capture.

this does mean that the higher bit rate will lead to a higher sound quality but
also does means a larger file size.
#+end_notes
** Calculating the size of a file
#+begin_notes
You can calculate the bitrate by multiplying the sample rate (the amount of
samples) with the bit depth (the size of each sample).

you can then multiply is with the duration (in seconds) to work out the file
size
#+end_notes
* Compression
#+begin_notes
Why do we need compression?
Well space is not infinite and some files are much larger than we need them to
be. We still need to keep them but they can be inconvenient for some reasons
such as backing up and transmitting data over the internet
#+end_notes
** Lossy
#+begin_notes
Lossy Compression is shrinking the file size using destructive means. this means
that some data is lost o shrink file size. this may be reducing the resolution
or colour depth of an image for example or removing some of the more extreme
notes in a sound track

Some examples of lossy standards are
- jpeg which works like this in principal (but is more complex in the
  background) on images
- mpeg is similar but works for audio and video making it more suitable for
  streaming and sending media over the internet
#+end_notes
** Lossless
#+begin_notes
Lossless compression on the other hand shrinks file size in a way that allows
for the data to be reconstructed. This is useful for formats that can't use
lossy compression. for example text files, spreadsheets, emails and so on.
This is great for backups as you get a file shrinkage and still have the full
quality file. though the file reduction will be smaller compared to a lossy
compression format
Some formats include
- pdf
- GIF
#+end_notes
*** Run length encoding
#+begin_notes
This is an example of an lossless compression we can use run length encoding.
essentially you group together any lengths of data that are the same (Show on
board)
