<h2 id="org803b51e">Why do we need primary storage</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
primary storage is the main storage the computer uses, Its used for anything
that needs to be accessed quickly, this means any open program, start up
instructions, the operating system, open files and so on.
</p>

<p>
The main types are RAM and ROM

<h2 id="orga5f2b0e">RAM</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
RAM stands for random access memory, its the main kind of primary storage used
in general computing, its very fast compared to secondary storage but is
volatile meaning it needs electrical power to operate and all data is wiped
after the computer is turned off.
</p>

<p>
the CPu can read and write to it (this is important for later).

<h3 id="org42f3756">The Purpose</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
As we have touched on before its purpose is to make processing faster (without
it computers would be unusably slow). they are part of the of the data access
chain. and its where most of your programs and files are stored when you open
them

<h2 id="orgf111afa">ROM</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
ROM or read only memory its usually used to provide the starting instructions
for the CPU loading and handing off control to the operating system, It can only
be read by the end user and requires special processes to overwrite. its non
volatile.
</p>

</aside>
<ul>
<li>Non Volatile</li>
<li>read only</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-orga47158c">
<h3 id="orga47158c">The Purpose</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
As mentioned its used to store instructions to then boot up the computer, its
also allows for computers to be turned off as its non volitile which makes them
more useful.

<h2 id="org4b5af89">Virtual Memory</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
A question arises from all of this, what happens when we run out of RAM? <b>ask</b>
</p>

<p>
Well this is dependent on OS, Windows stops allowing programs to ask for more
memory, while on linux is will kill programs using too much, this is not ideal
in a lot of cases and for the most part we don&rsquo;t need all programs to be in
memory at a time, if we are playing a game for example our word processor is
pretty inactive, that being said we don&rsquo;t want to lose our progress so thats
where virtual memory comes into place. we essentaially allocate parts of
secondary storage to act like RAM, We select parts of RAM that are inactive and
transfer them, and if they are needed by the CPU they are transfered back.
</p>

<p>
This only happens when RAM is full though as it can slow down a system by a lot,
Secondary storage is much slower and doing all of those reads and writes blocks
the rest of the system from running
