What is secondary storage,
</p>

<p>
its the main storage on the system. its where the operating system, programs and
files are stored.

<h2 id="org0487442">The need for secondary storage</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
computers would not be very useful if we lost all information everytime they
lost power. we would not be able to have things like laptops and phones (well
maybe).
</p>

<p>
we also need to look at what we are storing. operating systems are not small
things (well they can be but anyway) and we need to store other stuff like
programs and files and <del>shit</del> stuff. secondary storage allows us to store a lot
of this stuff so we need a low cost high storage medium

<h2 id="org40bf891">The factors</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Different mediums have different storage requirements
<b>ask what they may be?</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Capacity
How much data can the medium hold</li>
<li>Speed
How fast can the data be accessed</li>
<li>Portability
How easy is it to move the data medium</li>
<li>Durability
How strong is the medium? will it get damaged when moved around?</li>
<li>Reliability
Can the medium be used over and over again without fail?</li>
<li><p>
Cost
How expensive is the medium
</p>

<p>
we will see how each of these factors affect each medium
</p></li>

<h3 id="orgd54ee9c">Magnetic</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
The two main forms are hard disks (HDDs) and magnetic tape. they work using
magnatism to represent bits.
</p>
<ul>
<li>There size is mesured in the terabytes (millions of megabytes)</li>
<li>They are not very fast compared to other storage mediums</li>
<li>The disks themseves are large and are not as easy to trasnport (of course you
can throw pretty much any of these medums in a backpack and it will be fine
but its not as suitable)</li>
<li>They are not that durable. as they are moving components you can damage them
by moving them when operational. or by bringing them close to a magnetic or
electric field</li>
<li>They are infact very reliable. and magnetic tape is used for archival purposes</li>
<li><p>
they are not very expensive compared to other mediums
</p>

<p>
another disadvantage is disk fragmentation <b>explain on board</b>
</p></li>

</ul>

<p>
Uses. we have already mentioned archival but they are also used as the main
storage for computers and for laptops, they are also used in data centers due to
there cost to storage ratio

<h3 id="org766d891">Solid State Storage</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
solid state storage
Solid state storage does not have moving parts, they are much newer than hdd&rsquo;s.
its also know as flash memory.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The size is usually less than HDD&rsquo;s (this is less true now)</li>
<li>They are much faster than HDD&rsquo;s but not as fast as primary memory
this is mainly due to the lack of moving parts</li>
<li>they are much smaller and can be made into things like sd cards and pen drives
making them very portable. the full versions are also much smaller and lighter
than full hdd&rsquo;s making them more portable</li>
<li>They are much more durable than hdd&rsquo;s as they don&rsquo;t have moving parts.</li>
<li>They are as reiable though it should be said when they do fail they fail all
in one go while hdd&rsquo;s have warning signs</li>
<li>they are usually much more expensive (for your exam anyway)</li>

</ul>

<p>
they are used mainly in devices where size is important, thin laptops, tablets
and phones, they can also be used in a hybrid context, so you use an ssd as a
boot drive while you have a hdd for files and games and such (less frequently
used files)
</p>

<section id="slide-org036f928">
<h3 id="org036f928">Optical Storage</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Optical Storage is an older type of storage mainly used to move things around,
they are usually disks with little etches on them that are then read by a laser
</p>
<ul>
<li>they are much smaller than both SSD&rsquo;s and HDD&rsquo;s the biggest topping out at 50
gigs and most cheap ones holding only megabytes</li>
<li>they are nor very fast.
this is because they reintroduce a moving part</li>
<li>they are portable.
there small</li>
<li>they are not very durable, they snap easily and one scratch can corrupt all
the data</li>
<li>They are somewhat reliable</li>
<li><p>
they are very cheap.
though fro some the cost to storage ratio is very low
</p>

<p>
to add to this there are certain types. so
the CD is the oldest and stores the least. its in the megabytes. these are
read only
there is the DVD which can store a couple of gigabytes. the come in read only
and read and write configurations
there is blue ray which is only read only and can store 25 to 50 gigabytes of
storage they are the most expensive but are also the most used. for games and
movies and such
</p></li>
