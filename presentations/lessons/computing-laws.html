<aside class="notes">
<p>
The data protection act is a law to protect user data
</p>

<p>
Computers can contain a lot of data and with the rise of the internet
organisations can and will abuse that. The Data protection act is legislation
that protects users from some of this. its the UK&rsquo;s implementation of GDPR and
it tackles quite a few different aspects.

<h2 id="orge095d22">Computer Misuse act of 1990</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
The computer misuse act is a little more straight forward.
it makes it certain things criminal offences to make any unauthorised access to
computer material.
</p>
<ul>
<li>with intent to commit further criminal offences (for example extortion or blackmail)</li>
<li>with intent to modify computer material (for example a virus)</li>

</ul>

<p>
that first clause is targeted towards hacking (more formaly known as
unauthorised access)
the second clause refers to anything that impairs computer performance. a virus
may be one but another one may be a bitcoin miner

<h2 id="orgb0b80c9">Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (CDPA)</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Under this law it is illegal to copy, modify or distribute software and other
intellectual property without the relevant permissions (we will discuss that in
the next slide).
</p>

<p>
this is to protect the intellectual property of individuals and organisations.
this is not only for software but for audio, video books and so on.
</p>

<p>
TLDR, using the internet to download intellectual property (see 2 seconds ago)
without paying or attributing the work is illegal as said money or attribution
has not been passed along.

<section id="slide-org0053d72">
<h3 id="org0053d72">Proprietary Licensing</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Much of the code written by companies is written to make a profit, The source is
kept secret and versions are distributed as opaque executable, the user cannot
modify the source and to do so is illegal under which law? (the CDPA). You should
pay some money and hopefully in return they will provide support, updates and
bug fixes.
</p>

</aside>
</section>
<section id="slide-org8cb8c5d">
<h3 id="org8cb8c5d">Open Source Licensing</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Open Source Licensing is antithetical to proprietary software, Its source code is
freely available for anyone to use modify and distribute. its often regularly
updated by a community of very skilled developers who regularly test and send
out releases. these are then usually made available to anyone and everyone for
little to no cost. this is not to say that open source software is always free,
people do sell there open source software or provide support services or hosting
services to pay for the development.
</p>

<p>
Some downsides include, the developer may abandon the project on a whim,
and if there is a fault in the software they may or may not get fixed depending
on the developers (there may be no one to blame). this can be mitigated with
foundations and Charity which can act like a company and provide a line of
discussion.
</p>

<p>
Some examples of Open source software
(maybe ask?)
</p>
<ul>
<li>the Linux Operating system</li>
<li>The python programming languages</li>
<li>Most mainstream programming languages</li>
<li>Libre Office (a free and open source version of ms office)</li>

</ul>

<p>
There are no prescribed users for either. Amazon uses open source software and
proprietary software when needed.
</p>

<p>
that being said for the individual while the lower cost may be a benefit the
some what specialised forms of support challenging to use and may find the
proprietary support systems invaluable
</p>

<p>
&#x2014; Not needed
Some examples of Open software licensing is the MIT Licence or the Gnu General
Public Licence

<h3 id="org893c6a4">Creative Commons</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Creative commons does not really apply to software but to other assets like
Videos and books and music. it allows for work to be released under less
restrictive terms, default copyright prevents people from copying, distributing
or building on any work. in some cases its better to retain some rights then
reserve all rights as given by the CPDA
some examples of less restrictive works include.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Public Domain, which has no restrictions and can be used by anyone for
anything</li>
<li>Attribution, which requires the original creator to be credited but is
otherwise fair game</li>
<li>Attribution, non commercial, the work in question can be used by individuals
but not for commercial purposes (this usually entails companies but can be
stretched to mean any money making enterprise)</li>
