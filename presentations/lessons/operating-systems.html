<aside class="notes">
<p>
<b>Ask first</b>
Operating system is the main program that handles the <i>operation</i> of a computer
it provides a set of tools that allow users and programs to communicate
effectively.

<h2 id="orgc59417b">What an operating system provides</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
An operating system manages the hardware and the software, its the middle man
that talks to both sides of the computer and is essential for its function

<h3 id="org9bfa449">User interface</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
A user interface allows the user to interact with the system, this does not need
to be a graphical interface like the one most operating systems provide today, it can
be an entire text based interface like a terminal.
</p>

<p>
In a command line interface you need to learn commands for certain operations
and how to compose them.
</p>

<p>
In Windows you can still access a CLI using command prompts and in linux you
use a terminal program.
</p>

<p>
You can combine commands into larger programs using a script file, Batch on
windows and a shell script on linux.
</p>

<p>
even today they are still used mainly by people who want to avoid the gui for
certain tasks (either its slower or it does not provide the features needed.),
Its also used as its easier to script using a command line rather than a GUI

<h3 id="orgb2e52ad">Memory management</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Any program you use needs to be loaded up into memory, this means that the
operating system needs to manage memory effectively, it needs to allocate memory
effectively and load the first instruction of the program onto the CPU&rsquo;s program
counter. If the process requests more memory it needs to provide it or throw an
error (if the computer is out of memory for example) and then reclaim the
processes memory when its done.
</p>

<p>
Applications can only accept the memory that has been alocated to them, this is
a security feature that prevents snooping.
</p>

<p>
The OS Can also use a temporary buffer to store temporray data (for example a
program may spit out some data which needs to be used in a new process. this can
be stored in this temp buffer)
</p>

<p>
There is also a concept of multi tasking, on old operating systems you could
only have one program loaded into memory at a time, this was inconvienent so
multi taskers allowed for multiple programs be loaded into memory (they are
known as processes.) its then up to the OS to allocate CPU time to these
processes, this can allow for the illusion of concurency (processes running at
the same time) when in fact only one program (probably the one you are using) is
active.

<h3 id="org30708e1">Peripheral management</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
A computer is useless if we can&rsquo;t hook up keyboards and mice and things, thats
why the operating system also manages pheripherals,
</p>

<p>
a pheripheral is any piece of hardware that is not the CPU, so things like
monitors, keyboards, webcams, usb sticks and so on.
</p>

<p>
each of these devices have to have some kind of device driver, it essentially
acts like a translator turning operating system requests into low level signals
the device uses. without these drivers a computer would not be able to send and
receive data, each device has to have its own driver made for that device though most times generic
drivers can be included in the operating system directly as standards and best
practices have become more common (this makes devices plug and play)

<h3 id="org362e08f">User management</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
On a computer you will have differnet users, not all of them need full access,
thats why the operating system will make sure only certain users can access
certain things and do certain actions, for example you may have an admin account
that can install software and access all files, but then there are some basic
user accounts that only need to see there files and only use those same
programs, this is called access rights. the Operating system handles all of this
from creation to deletion of the user, promoting and demoting users, attaching
permisions to files and so on.
</p>

<section id="slide-orgaf1d35f">
<h3 id="orgaf1d35f">File management</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
File manangemt handles the storage and permisons of files, a special program
called a file system is used to create directory structures, manage the names,
locations of files and allocates the space for new files and so on. It keeps
track of the location of all of these files (as drives are flat and don&rsquo;t have
as sense of folders), it can also determine the file type (whether its binary,
text or some other format.)
</p>

<p>
When  computer is attached to a network its also used to control permisions of
who can access, write to or execute (run) a file. its a security measure to keep
a system secure.
