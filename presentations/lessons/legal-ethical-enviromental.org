* Impact of technology on wider society
** Ethical Issues
#+begin_notes
Ethical issues discuss the idea of right and wrong, while most people agree on
what is right and what is wrong there is not always a definitive definition.

the ethical way to use computers is to do so in a way that does not cause harm.
Do note however that just because something is immoral does not necessarily make
it illegal. breaking your mothers computer on purpose is immoral but not illegal
(tho if you did that to a business then it may in fact be illegal).
However is should be said a good legal system is grounded in good ethics

Ethics can be a very personal thing but can also be set out as a standard by a
group. the British Computer Science Society sets out some standards for all
computer professionals to follow, they include only doing work within there
capability and not taking bribes and not bringing the profession into disrepute

*** The idea of stake holders
#+begin_notes
A stakeholder is someone who may have an interest in or maybe affected by a
particular use of technology, for an example someone maybe a stakeholder in
google because they use there technology, even tho I have not actually got any
money spent in google, we are all a stake holder in webex as we have to use it
to conduct our lessons. stakeholders may have differing opinions on what an
eithical use of technology making somethings a moral grey area

*** the use of cctv in public places
#+begin_notes
CCTV is one example of this, to business owners and the police its a positive
thing as
- its a form of security that can be used to solve crime
- it can be used to identify and locate criminals faster
- It can reduce insurance premiums
while to some citizens who live in the area
- its an invasion of privacy
- it can be considered overreach by businesses and government

*** logging activities and the use of computers and phones in the workplace
#+begin_notes
Computer logging in the workplace is another example,
to you bosses
- enables them to monitor the effectivness of an employee
- reduces the risk of employees using the organisations faciliies for illgal or
  unacceptable purposes (like surfing social media)
to the employee
- its an invasion of there privacy
- forces them to be working constantly

** Legal issues
#+begin_notes
The legal impact will be discussed next week but the basic gist of it is that
the proliferation of computers have opened a can of worms that the law needs to
keep up with, there are many rules we are computer users must face but we shall
discuss that in more detail next week
#+end_notes
** Cultural issues
#+begin_notes
Culture discusses the ideas, behavios and values of a group. the use of
computers has and continues to have a widespread impact.
some of which include.
- mobile devices changing the way we interact with people and organisations like
  banks
- almost every industry has been disrupted, look at the film industry, now some
  movies don't even have releases in cinmas and come staight to our devices in
  the form of streaming services

  ask of any others
- the change in teaching from being most if not entirely in person to becoming
  either fully online or blended.
- the proliferation of online shopping leading to the decline of the highstreet
- the use of automation in work places making people redundant
#+end_notes
*** The internet and censorship
#+begin_notes
the web has become a place where anyone can post anything but at the same time
its become a place where companies and government's have a lot of control.

access to some websites and pages are blacklisted meaning people can't actually
view certain discussions. the extent to which this happens varys country to
country, buisnesses and goverments differ in what is acceptable.

this brings into question where to draw a line between protecting the public and
infringing on peoples right to freedom of speech

at a local level schools will blacklist websites that are unsutable for
children. at a national level some contries impose national level restrictions
on what can be seen to prevent public discourse

** Environmental issues
#+begin_notes
- computers consume a lot of energy, data centers all across the world will
  consume about 2% of world energy, similar to airlines
- consumer electronics need rare earth metals, the extraction of which can be
  damaging to the enviroment
- old computers are shipped off to land fills in developing countries that can
  then be picked by children to make some money, the improper disposing of it
  can lead to exposing them to harmful poisons.


this is not to say they are all bad
- they reduce the amount of paper used
- they allow people to work from home reducing CO2 emmissions from commuters
- they allow people to develop new forms of renewble enerhy as well as in there
  use
- they can be used to optimise energy use in a home with smart meters and the
  such

#+end_notes
** privacy issues
#+begin_notes
the problems with data collection
- A lot of companies collect data both willingly and unwillingly leading to
  false perceptions on what is being shared about them
- data collection is all around us
  - proctoring software as an example
  - CCTV
  - work place logging
  - mobile phones
