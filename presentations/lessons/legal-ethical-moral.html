<aside class="notes">
<p>
Ethical issues discuss the idea of right and wrong, while most people agree on
what is right and what is wrong there is not always a definitive definition.
</p>

<p>
the ethical way to use computers is to do so in a way that does not cause harm.
Do note however that just because something is immoral does not necessarily make
it illegal. breaking your mothers computer on purpose is immoral but not illegal
(tho if you did that to a business then it may in fact be illegal).
However is should be said a good legal system is grounded in good ethics
</p>

<p>
Ethics can be a very personal thing but can also be set out as a standard by a
group. the British Computer Science Society sets out some standards for all
computer professionals to follow, they include only doing work within there
capability and not taking bribes and not bringing the profession into disrepute

<aside class="notes">
<p>
A stakeholder is someone who may have an interest in or maybe affected by a
particular use of technology, for an example someone maybe a stakeholder in
google because they use there technology, even tho I have not actually got any
money spent in google, we are all a stake holder in webex as we have to use it
to conduct our lessons. stakeholders may have differing opinions on what an
eithical use of technology making somethings a moral grey area

<aside class="notes">
<p>
The legal impact will be discussed next week but the basic gist of it is that

keep up with, there are many rules we are computer users must face but we shall
discuss that in more detail next week

<h3 id="org40e6c78">Cultural issues</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Culture discusses the ideas, behavios and values of a group. the use of
computers has and continues to have a widespread impact.
some of which include.
</p>
<ul>
<li>mobile devices changing the way we interact with people and organisations like
banks</li>
<li><p>
almost every industry has been disrupted, look at the film industry, now some
movies don&rsquo;t even have releases in cinmas and come staight to our devices in
the form of streaming services
</p>

<p>
ask of any others
</p></li>
<li>the change in teaching from being most if not entirely in person to becoming
either fully online or blended.</li>

<h4 id="orgee47b8d">The internet and censorship</h4>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
the web has become a place where anyone can post anything but at the same time
its become a place where companies and government&rsquo;s have a lot of control.
</p>

<p>
access to some websites and pages are blacklisted meaning people can&rsquo;t actually
view certain discussions. the extent to which this happens varys country to
country, buisnesses and goverments differ in what is acceptable.
</p>

<p>
this brings into question where to draw a line between protecting the public and
infringing on peoples right to freedom of speech
</p>

<p>
at a local level schools will blacklist websites that are unsutable for
children. at a national level some contries impose national level restrictions
on what can be seen to prevent public discourse

<li>old computers are shipped off to land fills in developing countries that can
then be picked by children to make some money, the improper disposing of it
can lead to exposing them to harmful poisons.</li>

</ul>
