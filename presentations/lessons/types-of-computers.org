* Performance Characteristics of A CPU
#+begin_notes
Why do we need to worry about performace? Well different CPU's are better for
different application's
#+end_notes
** Clock Speed
#+begin_notes
The clock speed is how many instructions can be processed in a second.
for each clock cycle the CPU fetches and executes 1 instruction.
this is measured in cycles with a unit of Hz (cycles per second).
an increase in clock speed can lead to an increase in instructions processed in a
second and a faster experience overall .

current CPU's run at 4GHz or 4 billion cycles per second. so that's 4 Billion
Instructions processed per second (well more for the next couple of reasons).
#+end_notes
** Cores
#+begin_notes
Cores are how many compute nodes you have on the CPU. You can think about them
like lanes on a road. the more amount of instructions can be processed in one
cycle. adding another core doubles the amount of instructions
#+end_notes
** Cache
#+begin_notes
Cache is little bits of memory embedded on the CPU. its very fast but also much
smaller so its used to store the most recently used instructions. this means
that the CPU does not have to go all the way main memory to get data.

more cache more speed.

* Embedded systems
** What is an embedded system?
#+begin_notes
an embedded systems is a computer embedded in a larger device. they power most
things we use in everyday life such as washing machines ovens and televisions.
they are simple computers that can't be programmed by and end user
(maybe ask for examples?)
#+end_notes
** Why is an embedded system?
#+begin_notes
Why do we use embedded systems
(ask why?)

As a the machine in question is very specialised it does not need more general
components that a general purpose computer requires. this also means that
modularity is not really needed and everything is integrated directly onto the
CPU. they are also usually much smaller cheaper and slower as they do not need
to perform the many billions of calculations that modern general purpose cpu's
can do
