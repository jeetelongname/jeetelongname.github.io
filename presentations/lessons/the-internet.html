<p>
The internet is a massive WAN. it has its own protocol IP with each computer
connected having there own IP Address.
Every website has there own IP address which is used to access the

<h3 id="orgd91d9ff">IP addresses</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
IP or internet protocol is the main way we identify computers on the Internet.
</p>

<p>
each computer including the one your using has a unique IP address. this is used
to send data packets to your computer. Like how a mac address is used on a LAN.
</p>

<p>
the problem is this is not easy to memorise, try rememeberin 64.233.160.0 vs
google.com. to facilitate the last bit we use DNS

<h3 id="orgaa43711">DNS</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
DNS or domain name service is the main way to resolve URL&rsquo;s (uniform reasource
locatiors) to actual IP addresses. what happens is that when you type in an URL
is that it will send that to a known <b>dns server</b> which will then look up the IP
address in a big table, if there is a match then it will return the IP address
to the computer that requests it, if it cannot find it then it will pass the
request onto a bigger dns server its connected too, this will be passed up the
chain untill its been found or untill the last DNS server does not have a
reccord, when that happens is an error is passed back down to the User.
</p>

<p>
when the IP is returned to the user the computer then makes the reqest and the
process continues

<h3 id="orgba26eae">Hosting</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
We can now communicate but we need things to communicate too, Hosting is the act
performed by an internet host to run servers prividing different content. this
included
</p>

<ul>
<li>file hosting</li>
<li>web hosting</li>
<li>email hosting</li>

</ul>
<p>
and so on.
</p>

<p>
This in theory should then be accessable by any device on the internet.
</p>

<p>
This is funded by a sall fee but some provide free teirs.

<h3 id="org0580b94">The Cloud</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
The Cloud is a generic term for services and applications accessed over the
internet. this is used in contrast to apps used on your computer.
</p>

<p>
These are usually a network of servers, some that do file storage, some that do
applications, usually in large data centers. this is
</p>

<p>
examples include
google drive
google docs
amazon web services

<section id="slide-orge134615">
<h4 id="orge134615">Disadvantages</h4>
<ul>
<li>Requires an internet connection to access it</li>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Every Website is hosted on a <b>web server</b> this is a dedicated computer on the
internet that provides the website when requested. anyone can run there own
webserver but usually they go to a web hosting provider.
</p>

<p>
Anyone can write there own web server as long as they talk the same language
(usually https)

<h4 id="org10d8fad">Clients</h4>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Clients request the files from the server, when you visit a website the browser
is making a request for the website files. they are then downloaded onto your
computer and rendered
