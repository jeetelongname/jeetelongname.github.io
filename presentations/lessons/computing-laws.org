* Data Protection act of 2018
#+begin_notes
The data protection act is a law to protect user data

Computers can contain a lot of data and with the rise of the internet
organisations can and will abuse that. The Data protection act is legislation
that protects users from some of this. its the UK's implementation of GDPR and
it tackles quite a few different aspects.
#+end_notes
** Lawfulness, Fairness and transparency
#+begin_notes
- There must be a valid reasons to collect data
- You must not breach any laws with this data
- Data can only be used in ways that are fair, so it must be processed in a way
  that is not damaging, unexpected or misleading
- the collection must be open and honest from the start, it must say how they
  will use the data.

** Purpose Limitation
#+begin_notes
- the purpose of processing this data must be clear from the beginning.
- the purpose must be documented and specified in privacy information that is
  communicated to individuals
- Data must not be used for a new purpose unless its compatible with the old
  one. if needed new consent must be taken for this new use case

** Data minimisation
#+begin_notes
the Data in question needs to be
- Adequate
- relevant
- Limited (to what is needed)
#+end_notes

** Accuracy of held data
#+begin_notes
- All reasonable steps must be taken to ensure data is correct and not
  misleading
- Data must be kept up to date
- if data is incorrect it needs to be corrected or erased asap
- any challenges to the accuracy of this data must be considered

** Storage limitations
#+begin_notes
- if data is no longer needed it should not be kept
- how long data is kept for must be justified and specified in a policy
  statement
- there needs to be a periodic review of the data in hand and any not needed
  should be erased or anonymised.
- If a user requests data erasure that means organisations need to comply (its a
  right for the consumer)
- Data can be kept for longer only if its kept in for public interest archiving,
  scientific or historical research, or stats purposes

** Security measures
#+begin_notes
there must be adequate security measures in place to protect the data from bad
actors
#+end_notes
** Accountability
#+begin_notes
If something does go wrong the org needs to take responsibility for there
actions in accordance to the data protection act
#+end_notes

** Questions!
#+begin_notes
these are just some quick fire questions to check some understanding
#+end_notes
*** Name one principal of the data protection act.
*** Which one of these is *NOT* a principal of the data protection act
#+begin_notes
d
#+end_notes
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
a. Security
b. Accountability
c. Data minimisation
d. Integrity
*** Which of these is a sub principal of *Purpose limitation*
#+begin_notes
c
#+end_notes
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
a. there must be a valid reason to collect the data
b. All reasonable steps must be taken to ensure data is correct and not
   misleading
c. the purpose of processing this data must be clear from the beginning.
d. Data must be kept up to date

* Computer Misuse act of 1990
#+begin_notes
The computer misuse act is a little more straight forward.
it makes it certain things criminal offences to make any unauthorised access to
computer material.
- with intent to commit further criminal offences (for example extortion or blackmail)
- with intent to modify computer material (for example a virus)

that first clause is targeted towards hacking (more formaly known as
unauthorised access)
the second clause refers to anything that impairs computer performance. a virus
may be one but another one may be a bitcoin miner
#+end_notes
* Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (CDPA)
#+begin_notes
Under this law it is illegal to copy, modify or distribute software and other
intellectual property without the relevant permissions (we will discuss that in
the next slide).

this is to protect the intellectual property of individuals and organisations.
this is not only for software but for audio, video books and so on.

TLDR, using the internet to download intellectual property (see 2 seconds ago)
without paying or attributing the work is illegal as said money or attribution
has not been passed along.
#+end_notes
* Software Licensing.
** Proprietary Licensing
#+begin_notes
Much of the code written by companies is written to make a profit, The source is
kept secret and versions are distributed as opaque executable, the user cannot
modify the source and to do so is illegal under which law? (the CDPA). You should
pay some money and hopefully in return they will provide support, updates and
bug fixes.
#+end_notes
** Open Source Licensing
#+begin_notes
Open Source Licensing is antithetical to proprietary software, Its source code is
freely available for anyone to use modify and distribute. its often regularly
updated by a community of very skilled developers who regularly test and send
out releases. these are then usually made available to anyone and everyone for
little to no cost. this is not to say that open source software is always free,
people do sell there open source software or provide support services or hosting
services to pay for the development.

Some downsides include, the developer may abandon the project on a whim,
and if there is a fault in the software they may or may not get fixed depending
on the developers (there may be no one to blame). this can be mitigated with
foundations and Charity which can act like a company and provide a line of
discussion.

Some examples of Open source software
(maybe ask?)
- the Linux Operating system
- The python programming languages
- Most mainstream programming languages
- Libre Office (a free and open source version of ms office)

There are no prescribed users for either. Amazon uses open source software and
proprietary software when needed.

that being said for the individual while the lower cost may be a benefit the
some what specialised forms of support challenging to use and may find the
proprietary support systems invaluable

--- Not needed
Some examples of Open software licensing is the MIT Licence or the Gnu General
Public Licence
#+end_notes
** Creative Commons
#+begin_notes
Creative commons does not really apply to software but to other assets like
Videos and books and music. it allows for work to be released under less
restrictive terms, default copyright prevents people from copying, distributing
or building on any work. in some cases its better to retain some rights then
reserve all rights as given by the CPDA
some examples of less restrictive works include.
- Public Domain, which has no restrictions and can be used by anyone for
  anything
- Attribution, which requires the original creator to be credited but is
  otherwise fair game
- Attribution, non commercial, the work in question can be used by individuals
  but not for commercial purposes (this usually entails companies but can be
  stretched to mean any money making enterprise)
#+end_notes
* Questions (2)
** WHat are the seven principal's of the data protection act
** What is the purpose of the computer misuse act
** Describe creative commons
** What licence should someone use if they wanted to put a picture on the internet but does not want companies to use it
** Name 2 differences between proprietary and open source software.
** Exam question.
