<h3 id="orgb3e101d">Encryption software</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
most modern operating systems contain some kind of encrytion software too make
sure users can&rsquo;t access un authorised files.
</p>

<p>
encryption software scrambles a file into cypher text which can then be
reconstructed by the user when some secret key is provided.
</p>

<p>
some examples of encryption software is gpg on linux, bitlocker on Windows and
file vault on macos, these systems automatically decrypt files usually on login
so the user does not even need to think about it.
</p>

<p>
This is very important for laptops as they can be easily stolen which leads can
lead to data breaches and all the fun things that entails (see the GDPR laws)

<h3 id="orgd2d3f6e">Defragmentation software</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Defragmentation software has been discussed but usually comes with the OS,
essentally it brings blocks of data that have been seperated by just general use
closer together to improve read and write performance
</p>

<p>
its important to note that users should not defragment an ssd as it has no
benifts and causes unnessasary read and write operations degrading the disk

<h3 id="org26cf528">Data Compression</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Data compression is the act of making files smaller through some process, there
are 2 types, lossy and lossless, the latter shrinking destructively and the
former using algo&rsquo;s which can then be used to expand the file back out.
