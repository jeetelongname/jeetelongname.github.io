* Client Server Vs Peer to Peer
** Client Server networks
#+begin_notes
A Client Server networks is one where resources are centralised into one place
(known as a server.) Servers are usually high end computers that are meant to
provide a resources. some examples
#+end_notes
- File Server :: Stores user documents and files
- Authentication Servers :: Checks whether a user can log in and control the
  resources they can access
- Application Servers :: Provides an application that can run over the network
- Print Servers :: Manages Printing over a network
- Mail Servers :: Stores and handles emails.
*** Advantages
- Easier to Secure
- Means that no one client is required for the function of the network
- Things like Backups, security and admin are centrally managed
*** Disadvantages
- If a server goes down, the entire network goes down
- If a server gets overwhelmed then the entire network is affected.
- Servers are more expensive than regular clients
- If there is an attack on the network then only the server needs to be attacked
** Peer to Peer
#+begin_notes
A Peer to Peer network connects every node to every other node. its
decentralises resources. They are used for small businesses that only need
#+end_notes
*** Advantages
- Easy to set up
- There is no single point of failure
- No expensive hardware.
*** Disadvantages
- Without a central server there is no easy central management
- No Central backups
- If a device is not online that means the resources they share are not
  available
* Typologies
#+begin_notes
A topology is a way to organise nodes in a network
#+end_notes
** Ring
#+begin_notes
A ring network connects network in a ring.
#+end_notes
*** Advantages
- Easy to set up
- Easy to add too
*** Disadvantages
- If one node is offline the entire network is offline
- Can lead to data collisions
** Bus
#+begin_notes
A central line connects networks together with terminators on each end
#+end_notes
*** Advantages
- Easy to set up
*** Disadvantages
- Hard to add too (as you need to splice in a cable)
- Lots of data collisions
** Star
#+begin_notes
A central re sending node (such as a switch or hub) will broadcast packages.
This is the network used by most networks
#+end_notes
*** Advantages
- No network collisions
- No downtime when adding new nodes
*** Disadvantages
- Central point of failure
- Expensive kit
** Mesh
#+begin_notes
Every node is connected to every other node.
#+end_notes
*** Advantages
- No single point of failure
- No single data line to overwhelm
- No special hardware
*** Disadvantages
- Lots of wiring
- Lots of connections to maintain and lots of small things to do.
# * The Internet
# #+begin_notes
# The internet is a massive WAN. it has its own protocol IP with each computer
# connected having there own IP Address.
# Every website has there own IP address which is used to access the
# #+end_notes
# ** IP addresses
# ** DNS
# ** Hosting
# ** The Cloud
# ** Web servers and Clients
* Questions
** What is a network topology
** Describe a star topology
** What are 2 advantages and 2 disadvantages of client server networks
** What is a disadvantage of mesh network
** What are some of the servers used in a client server network (name 3)
