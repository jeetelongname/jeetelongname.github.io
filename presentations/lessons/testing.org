* What is testing?
#+begin_notes
testing is the process of making sure our program is correct. its used in many
forms all over the industry but here are the basics
#+end_notes
* What are the types of testing?
** Iterative
#+begin_notes
happens while the program is being developed usually testing one bit of
functionality
#+end_notes
** Final or black box
#+begin_notes
This happens near the end of a programs development. this is to test the program
in its whole to catch any bugs iterative testing missed, its also known as black
box testing as we are not worried about what the program is doing inside the box
just that it does work
#+end_notes
* Types of errors
** Syntax errors
#+begin_notes
These are usually caught by the language itself. for example this is a syntax
error in python. these are easy to catch and easy to solve (in this case we need
to just close the paren)
#+end_notes
#+begin_src python
print("hello world"
#+end_src

** Logic errors
#+begin_notes
logic errors are harder as its otherwise valid code. here is an example

this is why external testing is important as its easy to catch these errors if
you know what you are looking for.
#+end_notes
#+begin_src python
def add2(x, y):
    return x * y
#+end_src
* Types of test data
** Normal
#+begin_notes
this is the normal data expected, if this fails you have a big problems
#+end_notes
** Boundary
#+begin_notes
this is data on the edge of what is acceptable, lets say you need to take in a
date to show that people are over the age of 18. you would need to discard dates
after 3rd march 2004 but that date is also valid and needs to be checked.
#+end_notes
** invalid
#+begin_notes
this is data that is of the same type (so in this example a date) but is
otherwise wrong
#+end_notes
** erroneous
#+begin_notes
this is data that is of the wrong type and should be discarded always
#+end_notes
* Refining algorithms
#+begin_notes
this is usually in realtion to fining things that are wrong and correcting them
but can also relate to makeing algo's more efficent
#+end_notes
* Questions
** What i meant by normal test data?
** How is Boundary data different from erroneous data
** Exam question
