Before we begin what are all of your names
</p>

<p>
I am Jeet. I am currently studying computer science and university

<h2 id="orgd276e33">How these lessons will work</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
We have an hour and a half here. 6:30 to 8pm.
I have split it in twain, 45 minutes of &ldquo;structured&rdquo; teaching, 45 minutes for
you to ask questions, for us to explore a topic, for you to sit in silence and
do some work.
Do bring questions. I will try and answer them the best I can, and If I cannot I
will get an answer too you through our communication channels.
Nothing is too stupid to ask.
</p>

<p>
The lessons themselves wil consist of slides, interactive whiteboards and other
small things. I will try and make them interactive so be ready to answer
questions! but if its not working for you, tell me! I am more than happy to work
another way if it means you guys understand!
You can also ask clarifying questions as I am moving
</p>

<p>
The homework I will set will be small but good practice. I will try and mark it
in a timely manner but tease me if I do not.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
We will be covering everything on your course. but we will also go a little
further to try and build a solid computing base.
</p>

<p>
This means learning extra python concepts that you will not need but are helpful
for understanding. going a little further, or going off the spec. this is to
hopefully not only get you to pass to pass but hopefully to build up a good
understanding of what is happening.

<h2 id="orgf1931ea">We are begining with algorithms and python.</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
We are starting here as topics can and do blend into one another. Its a good
place to begin. From these topics we can then disucuss core topics in terms of
the last. which should hopefully form connections and make things more clear in
the long run.
