#+begin_notes
compare him to this guy
this guy has no soul left. he sacrificed it all to satan to make sure his
dotfiles are reproducible (which is still not entirely true). We are going to
chart the path I took as a warning but also a guide to all the weary travellers
looking for the sweet embrace of a comfy system

* the beginning
#+begin_notes
Its a pretty good place to start.

I have been using linux for about two years. I started just before my GCSES
(which is a set of final exams for 16 year olds). It became a hobby to fiddle
with my os and learn about the different programs in it and there interactions.
This hobby only grew with the time a post exam summer gives you and before I
knew it I was heading into 6th form (the final 2 years where we specialse into 3
subjects). I got a new laptop and used windows for a while then christmas break
came around and I wiped my drive trying to dual boot. this was actually a good
thing as I could give linux half of my drive and from that day on I started
daily driving linux. It was also around this time I started to look for vscode
replacements.
#+end_notes
** Vscode replacements
#+begin_notes
I was tired of vscode. I mainly used it as it had a monopoly in my comp sci
class. but it always felt like an incomplete solution. It was opaque, hard to
extend and a pain to integrate into my growing dotfile collection.
I tried a lot of different editors.
- gnome builder
- gedit
- vim
- vscodium
- pycharm
I think there was even a point where I was considering libre office writer.
all of them had there problems and non of them really stuck.

then that infamous distrotube video came out and just like with linux I fell in love.
It ticked all of my boxes. It was fate.

- gnome builder

- vim
- vscodium
- pycharm
** How doom sucked me in
#+begin_notes
doom checked all of the boxes when all the other editors only could tick one or two

- It was fast (mostly)
- clean
- easy to extend and hack on
- and the community is great (this is a surprise we will use later on!)
Add to that the legends around emacs and some of the best vim emulation I have
seen and I was hooked. /like a fish on a line/

* My descent begins in the init.el
#+begin_notes
Being new to this entire world seeing all of those tools and languages in the
init.el felt like chistmas. for a while it felt like shopping when I opened that
file and it gave me a lot of bread crumbs to go and explore. and explore I did!
from the little witisms I read about the languages and tools doom had set up and
worked my way through some of them. This alone was not enough to turn me into
the mad man I am now tho. I needed a place to talk about them and boi did the
doom community help with that.
#+end_notes
* The doom community's deep rabbit holes
#+begin_notes
while doom itself helped facilitate my bike shedding somewhat. It was the people
that really drove me to learn more. I spent a lot of time lurking in the sub
watching as Tecosaur did some really cool stuff with latex and org. tools I knew
of but had not used for anything more than a small document. Monad showed me the
way of the haskeller reciting spells I wish I understood (and kindof do now). I
had reached the mouth of the rabbit hole and it was you guys who pulled me in.

From there on out I was now not only hooked on doom but all of the stuff that
the doom community had showed me.
#+end_notes
* Where are we now?
#+begin_notes
so we have charted my path to where we are now. but where is that?
well..

- I now use org for all of my document preparation except for large documents
which I then use latex. meaning all of my friends hate my pdf's
- email, rss, irc are all in emacs with the last two only ever being used in emacs
- I have now got a dotfiles repo that is tied into nix. I don't think I can ever
leave now. (you could call it Stockholm syndrome).
- I have tried many new
languages. some of which have come to be my favorites
- and because of the stuff this server has shown me I was able to give a set of
lessons to a set of students on topics like the shell, git, latex and scheme.
Without this community showing me the way I would not have known about half of
these let alone teach them.

- email, rss, irc are now all in Emacs
- my dotfiles are tied to nix

- I was able to give lessons on everything I had learned

Thanks for listening
