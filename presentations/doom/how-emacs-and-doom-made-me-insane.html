compare him to this guy
this guy has no soul left. he sacrificed it all to satan to make sure his
dotfiles are reproducible (which is still not entirely true). We are going to
chart the path I took as a warning but also a guide to all the weary travellers
looking for the sweet embrace of a comfy system

Its a pretty good place to start.
</p>

<p>
I have been using linux for about two years. I started just before my GCSES
(which is a set of final exams for 16 year olds). It became a hobby to fiddle
with my os and learn about the different programs in it and there interactions.
This hobby only grew with the time a post exam summer gives you and before I
knew it I was heading into 6th form (the final 2 years where we specialse into 3
subjects). I got a new laptop and used windows for a while then christmas break
came around and I wiped my drive trying to dual boot. this was actually a good
thing as I could give linux half of my drive and from that day on I started
daily driving linux. It was also around this time I started to look for vscode
replacements.

I was tired of vscode. I mainly used it as it had a monopoly in my comp sci
class. but it always felt like an incomplete solution. It was opaque, hard to
extend and a pain to integrate into my growing dotfile collection.
I tried a lot of different editors.
</p>
<ul>
<li>gnome builder</li>
<li>gedit</li>
<li>vim</li>
<li>vscodium</li>
<li>pycharm</li>

</ul>
<p>
I think there was even a point where I was considering libre office writer.
all of them had there problems and non of them really stuck.
</p>

<p>
then that infamous distrotube video came out and just like with linux I fell in love.
It ticked all of my boxes. It was fate.

<p>
doom checked all of the boxes when all the other editors only could tick one or two
</p>

<ul>
<li>It was fast (mostly)</li>
<li>clean</li>
<li>easy to extend and hack on</li>
<li>and the community was great (this is a surprise we will use later on!)</li>

</ul>
<p>
Add to that the legends around emacs and some of the best vim emulation I have
seen and I was hooked. <i>like a fish on a line</i>
