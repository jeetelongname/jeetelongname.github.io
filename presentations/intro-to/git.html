<aside class="notes">
<p>
version control is a way to manage and back up source code
It is the industry standard practice to keep code under some kind of version
control and the most widly used VCS is called git. you have probably heard of it
from services such as github and gitlab.
</p>

<ul>
<li>breaking code changes into revisions or &ldquo;commits&rdquo; each identifyable using a
uniqe hash.</li>
<li>allowing for people to non destructivly make copys of the code and merge them
in when developed</li>
<li>facilitating the ability to checkout and roll back commits</li>
<li>push the source code to a remote for backups</li>

<h2 id="orga633026">Why use Version control? (git)</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
other than it being the industry standard it also has a lot of benefits such as
</p>
<ul>
<li>Breaking up code revisions into smaller chunks called &ldquo;commits&rdquo;
which makes it easier to see how the code base changed over time</li>
<li>Allowing you to roll back commits for whatever reason
git also provides tools to find the last good commit called bisecting</li>
<li>Allowing you to change your code base without affecting a master copy of your
code
Meaning you can add features and merge them in when they are ready while also
shipping a stable version</li>
<li>making it easier to collaborate and scale your code base to include more people</li>
<li>as well as other benefits</li>
