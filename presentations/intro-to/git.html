<h2 id="orgda73dcb">What is version control?</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
version control is a way to manage and back up source code
It is the industry standard practice to keep code under some kind of version
control and the most widely used VCS is called git. you have probably heard of it
from services such as github and gitlab.
</p>

</aside>

<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in"><b>Some features of Version control:</b></li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">breaking code changes into revisions or &ldquo;commits&rdquo; each identifiable using a
unique hash.</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">allowing for people to non destructively make copies of the code and merge them
in when developed.</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">facilitating the ability to checkout and roll back commits throughout gits
history</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">push the source code to a remote for backups and easy sharing of the source
code.</li>

<h2 id="org95e3312">Why use Version control? (git)</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
other than it being the industry standard it also has a lot of benefits such as
</p>
<ul>
<li>Breaking up code revisions into smaller chunks called &ldquo;commits&rdquo;
which makes it easier to see how the code base changed over time</li>
<li>Allowing you to roll back commits for whatever reason
git also provides tools to find the last good commit called bisecting</li>
<li>Allowing you to change your code base without affecting a master copy of your
code
Meaning you can add features and merge them in when they are ready while also
shipping a stable version</li>
<li>making it easier to collaborate and scale your code base to include more people</li>
<li>as well as other benefits</li>

<h3 id="orgf47e333">Staging</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Staging is the git term for getting files ready for commits. When you need to
add new changes you need to add the file to the stage before committing it. This
may seem tedious but means you don&rsquo;t need to commit all of your changes by one go
and commit based on the task you are completing.
</p>

<section id="slide-org70f9d7d">
<h4 id="org70f9d7d">add</h4>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
To add a file / your changes to a file you use the git add command you specify
the file you want to add.
</p>

<p>
too add all of your changes you can use the . symbol (which stands for the
current directory as we discussed from our last lesson)
</p>

<h4 id="org3a2d094">restore</h4>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
To remove a file you can use the restore command. provide it with a file and it
will unstage the file. to unstage all files you use dot like before. be careful
as without the &#x2013;staged flag you would delete your changes which is not fun. You
can set an alias for it tho which would probably make your life easier to make a
git alias
</p>

<h3 id="org675a2b3">Commits</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
We have discussed the precursor to committing so now we need to actually commit
to it
</p>

<p>
A git commit is a collection of changes that will be added to your git history.
commits represent the backbone of git and its important you make your commits
small and to the point. don&rsquo;t try and stuff too many features into one commit as
you lose a lot of the benefits of git. (as a rule of thumb try and keep each
commit down to one fix or feature. eg a small bug fix or the addition of a
function)
</p>

</aside>
</section>
<section id="slide-orga5a40d4">
<h4 id="orga5a40d4">commit</h4>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
To create a commit you call the <code>commit</code> command. this will open up an editor for
you to then type in a commit message. I won&rsquo;t go deep into commit etiquette but I
recommend you search conventional commits as it provides a good framework for
commit messages
</p>

<p>
There are 2 flags that are useful but not recommended for proper projects
the -a flag which commits all changes in the current directory
and the -m flag which will allow you to type a message inline without using an
editor.
</p>

<h3 id="orgefb0307">Branches</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Branching is another really powerful feature of git. It allows you to make
sweeping changes to your code without damaging the master copy of your code.
</p>

<p>
Branches are cheap to make (taking up very little space) meaning you have no
reason to use them!
</p>

<p>
The main use of branches is to separate stable code from new features or bug
fixes. This allows you to change the code to your hearts content without
damaging your main copy
</p>

</aside>
</section>
<section id="slide-org81e6625">
<h4 id="org81e6625">branch</h4>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
creating branches is quite easy. you just call the branch command and it will
create a branch starting at the current branch. You can specify a different
branch by providing it
</p>

<p>
to delete a branch you add the -d flag
</p>

<p>
If there are unmerged changes and the branch is not backed up you will need to
force git by using the -D flag
</p>

<h4 id="org1f4a6f9">checkout</h4>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
We have created branches but now we need to use them so we use the checkout
command
</p>

<p>
git actually has a shortcut to create a new branch and switch to it. by adding
the -b flag to the checkout command you can create a new branch there and then
</p>

</aside>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash"><span style="color: #87ceeb;">git</span> checkout &lt;branch_name&gt; <span style="color: #6c6f93; background-color: #292b36; font-style: italic;"># </span><span style="color: #6c6f93; background-color: #292b36; font-style: italic;">switch to that branch</span>

<h3 id="orga941ab7">Merging</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Now that we have these branches we need to actually do something with them.. we
discussed deleting them but that&rsquo;s not that useful. We need a way to merge them
and update them as time goes on
</p>

</aside>
</section>
<section id="slide-org3dd5af0">
<h4 id="org3dd5af0">merge</h4>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
merging takes the commits of the provided beach and <i>merges</i> them into the current
branch by making a merge commit. this tells git what commits have been merged
into the current branch. As its a commit if you are not happy with the merge you
can rollback the commit like any other. This is also known as non destructive
merging
</p>

<p>
the problem here is that there will be a commit every time you merge the branch
which can make the history of the branch messy and not that great. that is where
the next kind of merging comes into play
</p>

</aside>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash"><span style="color: #87ceeb;">git</span> checkout master

<section id="slide-org2a431c7">
<h4 id="org2a431c7">rebase</h4>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
rebasing rewrites the history of the current branch to incorporate the changes
of the merging branch. this changes the history of the branch which is pretty
dangerous that being said it also makes the code history much more readable
and makes the project history linear. there are no forks to contend with making
it much easier to follow a projects history.
</p>

<p>
This comes at the cost of safety you are rewriting your history which every time
travel show I have watched has said is a really dangerous thing to do. You also
lose some context provided by the merge commit
</p>

<p>
as for where to use which. I
recommended you rebase your main branch onto your feature branches and merge your
feature branches into your main. This is what I see happen a lot but this is not
a hard and fast rule

<aside class="notes">
<p>
We have reached another conundrum all of this code is local. We need a way to
get it out into the world. We could put all of this code in a drop box folder
and share that but I think you know that i am going to show you how to use git
to do that

<h4 id="org66d7285">remote</h4>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
A remote is an online location for your code. people upload there code to github
or gitlab some people even host there own server. but all are valid remotes
</p>

<p>
to add one you call the remote add command and provide it with a name and the
url
</p>

<p>
to change the url call the set-url command
</p>

and then rename and remove are self explanatory

<h4 id="org0cebec9">push</h4>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
To send your changes to your new fangled remote you use the push command. it
takes the argument of the remote and the branch to push. when pushing the branch
for the first time you should add the -u flag which tracks the branch
</p>

<p>
You may need to also overwrite the remote for some reason this is risky as you
could lose work other people push.

<p>
git fetch will download the files from a remote without doing anything with
them. This allows you to look at what other people are doing without
affecting your local copy. you can then merge it into your local copy later if
you wish.
</p>

<p>
note when you check out <code>some-branch</code> you will be in a detached head state which
means that you can edit all of this and it will not affect your history

<p>
pull is used to update your local branch with the changes of upstream. this is
used a lot when working in a group and you need to get the changes from
upstream. It fetches from upstream and then merges it into your code. If you
want to rebase instead of merge you can use -r.

the log command shows you a timeline of your code on the commit level you can

<p>
revert takes a hash (or the amount of commits you want to go back from) and will
make a new commit with those changes applied. essentially rolling back to that
commit.
</p>

<p>
also note you don&rsquo;t need to paste in the entire commit hash you can get away
with the first 5 terms and git will figure out the rest
</p>

<p>
If that is still too much work you can then use some special syntax to roll back
a certain amount of commits from the current one or the HEAD commit
All its saying is roll back one commit behind head. we can put any number there
but its not really a good solution if you need to go back to a specific commit

<p>
Well you need to use git. I recommend you try and use git with any and every one
of your projects. I actually used git for my NEA and it helped keep a record of
what I have done and how long it took.
</p>

<p>
And this is not the only way to use git. most text editors worth there salt have
some sort of git integration and there are usually 3rd party front ends that can
make using git much nicer and faster.
