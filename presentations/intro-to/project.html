<h2 id="org2194ef5">Lets make a python project!</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
Today we are going to get the basic infrastructre down for a python project and
use what we have learned to get us started not only on a python project but in
the ways of the developer

<h2 id="org72a4ae8">poetry new</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
poetry is a dependency managment and project lifecycle tool that makes managing
dependencys and virtual enviroments a very easy experience.
</p>

<p>
you should have it installed so that you can follow along and get a feel for it

<h2 id="orgd47bef2">initalising git</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
we are now going to make an empty git repo
who knows the command to do that?
</p>

<p>
we will then add and commit all of these files to our history. we will come back
to git in a bit when we want to back up our code
</p>

<h2 id="org17af9bd">poetry add</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
How many people here plan on using a library that does not come with python?
</p>

<p>
Poetry makes managing these librarys much easier. you can add them to your
pyproject.toml file yourself or you can just use the poetry add command which
does it for you
</p>

<p>
install ropes and antigravity

<h2 id="orgc8e38ec">poetry install</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
We have added them to our config but now we need to install them. poetry install
to the rescue! it will just install the depenencys. do notes that it won&rsquo;t
install it globablly but just for this project. This is by design and means you
can have multiple versions of the same dependency installed at the same time.

<h3 id="orgfc056d1"><code>__init__.py</code></h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
the init.py is used to tell python that the code in this directory is a module.
You can think of it as the <span class="underline"><span class="underline">init</span></span> function when you make a class.
</p>

</aside>

<section id="slide-org6017431">
<h3 id="org6017431"><code>__main__.py</code></h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
The main.py tells python that out of all the files in a folder to run. run
this one first. its useful for many reasons one of them being it allows you to
run a directory!. It also makes your module a standalone application that python
can just sort of run
</p>

<p>
python -m http.server 8080

<section id="slide-orgc0a1017">
<h3 id="orgc0a1017">quick sidenote on your own modules</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
You can seperate your code into its own files by making a file and then
importing it in your main document with the name of the file without the .py
extension

<h2 id="orgfb1e015">Now we upload to github!</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
So we have added some code and we have remembered to commit it now we have to
upload it to github. first we make the repo on github so that our remote exists
then we can create it
</p>

<p>
git remote add origin url
</p>

<p>
git push -u origin senpai

<h2 id="orgb6107a4">Now we have discussed the code now we are going to discuss the documentation</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
who has used a markup language
An intro to latex
</p>

<p>
latex is a declarative document preperation language. It is used to write papers
letters, books and any other document you could want. If you really want to get
into it you can pick up the fundementals in an afternoon
</p>

<p>
If you don&rsquo;t want to install latex you can use the website overleaf.com which
provides web interface to do all of the editing. kind of like google docs
</p>

<p>
Its a markup language used for scientific literature books and even NEA&rsquo;s
</p>

<p>
It can be a bit of a pain to set up your document but after it is done you don&rsquo;t
have to touch your formatting ever again

<h2 id="org1d45c08">Thanks for dealing with me!</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
I hope this has been educatonal and I hope you have had a bit of fun! I know I
have.
</p>

<p>
If anything I really hope you have picked up that spending some time learning
and getting out of your comfort zone can be a boon to your productivity and that
computer science is not just stacks and queues
</p>

<p>
I would have wanted to cover latex in more detail and I also wanted to cover vim
but I will leave that to you to look into if your so enclined
</p>

<p>
Thanks for listening
