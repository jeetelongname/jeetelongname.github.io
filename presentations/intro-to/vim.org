* What is vim?

Vim is a terminal and Modal text editor. it is known as the editor no one can
exit out of. as well as being very extendable and having a learning curve

* Why use vim?
#+begin_notes
vim is found as the default editor on a lot of linux distros and the basic
ability to use it effectively will come in handy when you need to change a
configuration file

on a mroe philosophical note. vim adds a grammer to your editing which can make
your editing fit more in line with the way you think. the additions of key
commands can make your workflow faster and make your editing more smooth.

plus you get all the bragging rights and eliteism that comes with vim ;)

** What are Modes?
#+begin_notes
Modes are a concept birthed from vim. they tell the keyboard how to process a
key press. it can be processed as a simple character entry or a command of some
kind.

for our purposes there are 4 modes we need to worry about

- normal mode
  which is the default and the main one we will discuss
- Insert mode which is very similar to the kind of editing you are used to
- Command mode its very similar to the vscode command pallet if you have used
  that
- and Visual mode which is used to make visual selections
