* What is version control?
#+begin_notes
version control is a way to manage and back up source code
It is the industry standard practice to keep code under some kind of version
control and the most widly used VCS is called git. you have probably heard of it
from services such as github and gitlab.

- breaking code changes into revisions or "commits" each identifyable using a
  uniqe hash.
- allowing for people to non destructivly make copys of the code and merge them
  in when developed
- facilitating the ability to checkout and roll back commits
- push the source code to a remote for backups

- *Some features of Version control:*
- breaking code changes into revisions or "commits" each identifiable using a
  unique hash.
- allowing for people to non destructively make copies of the code and merge them
  in when developed.
- facilitating the ability to checkout and roll back commits thorughout gits
  history
- push the source code to a remote for backups and easy sharing of the source
  code.

* Why use Version control? (git)
#+begin_notes
other than it being the industry standard it also has a lot of benefits such as
- Breaking up code revisions into smaller chunks called "commits"
  which makes it easier to see how the code base changed over time
- Allowing you to roll back commits for whatever reason
  git also provides tools to find the last good commit called bisecting
- Allowing you to change your code base without affecting a master copy of your
  code
  Meaning you can add features and merge them in when they are ready while also
  shipping a stable version
- making it easier to collaborate and scale your code base to include more people
- as well as other benefits

* Some concepts
** Starting off
*** init
#+begin_notes
Lets say you need to start a project you can just do a git init to initialise an
empty git repository
#+end_notes
#+begin_src bash
$ git init
#+end_src
*** clone
#+begin_notes
If you need to work on some other project or reclone one you have already
started then you can use the clone command
#+end_notes

#+begin_src bash
$ git clone https://some.website/repo.git
# eg
$ git clone https://github.com/jeetelongname/website.git
#+end_src
