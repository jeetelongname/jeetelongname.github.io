A small poem on sleep deprivation

<div class="verse">

I watch the world defrost<br />
As i sit reading another note<br />
hear the birds begin to accost<br />
As I type out more bloat.<br />
<br />
My brain begins to close<br />
The fingers grow tired<br />
As the table falls to my nose<br />
and my body has fully retired<br />

</div>
