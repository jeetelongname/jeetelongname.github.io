# Fight Club. A confusing look on masculinity, society and gender

**This look into fight club contains spoilers**

I recently watched fight club the 1999 movie Staring Edward Norton and Brad
Pitt. I left the film in a kind of daze. It was cohesive it was tight and it was
for all intents and purposes a good film. I would not say I enjoyed it tho.

The reason I say that is because I find its message being polluted with its
glorification of toxic masculine traits. The movies central themes revolve
around the idea that men even when they are "the warm little center that
the life of this world crowded around." are still struggling with pains and
illnesses. These men feel like they have been ignored. That the script of
getting an education, getting a job, filling up a small city apartment with
meaningless things does not feed that hole in them and they have no out. There
pain is told to be insignificant and to compare there situation to people who
have blood parasites or testicular cancer.

This pain has no out so the movie creates a "fight club" to indulge in the
stereotype that men have a violent tendency growing inside of them. This fight
club is used as a way to vent this energy and to build a sense of community
something we see grow into the project mayhem later on in the film.

The first tenet of this film the thing that gives it its name is not a healthy
thing. Violence is usually never the answer to a problem and a healthier
reaction to pain and to being ignored is to talk about it and be open about
being in pain. To a degree the film agrees with me. We see the narrator as he
dives deeper into this rabbit hole with Tyler, we see his sense of self degrade
we see him take more risks we see him live a mentally unhealthy life. A life
that only comes to an end with both a metaphorical and physical bullet being
shot into the narrator's head killing Tyler. This is usually shared between many
of the major plot points except one. The movie glorifies the idea of hitting
bottom as a way to reset your life for the better.

## Hitting bottom and fight club.

The movie uses the idea of hitting bottom as a way to discuss the idea of
resetting a life. In this context hitting bottom is [a euphemism for reaching
the lowest point of a
spiral](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/hit+rock+bottom). It is seen as
being a good thing to lean into this decline until you can't go further. Then
and only then can you start to lift yourself out of this spiral. This is not
good advice and can actually be dangerous. In the movie "bottom" is shown as a
car crash and as shooting yourself in the head which are not advisable. In the
real world hitting bottom can be really destructive. for some people its
reveling in the mess they have gotten into. for others its suicide. You can
always get help at any point and it should not be seen as some sort of reset.

Fight club disagree's.
Fight club embraces the spiral and uses bottom as a way continue the narrative.
Its ending uses the idea of hitting bottom as a justification to blow up credit
card companies and wipe out all of the debt associated with it.
