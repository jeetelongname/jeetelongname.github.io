# This blog has been a bit quiet.

I enjoy writing about things, I have many things to write about. but I never do.
why is that?

## I dislike the blogging system I have chosen.

Hugo is a fine piece of work don't get me wrong, but for me it feels incomplete
in a certain sense. The site is configured through a central `config.toml` and
while this is a good idea on its surface, due to the freedom themes have it can
lead to not fully knowing what is allowed by the theme and what is not, this can
lead to a lot of time debugging themes and leads to being frustrated by the
experience.

as for writing my own themes while I could do so, my lack of actual design
knowledge would have lead to quite a fugly experience. this is less a fault of
hugo and more a fault of myself. Hugo is actually very well documented on its
templates and I am sure If I ever spent time working on a theme I would have
little issue.

## I dislike markdown as a writing tool.

This comes onto my second point. I use emacs pretty much daily and with that
comes org mode. not only is it a better system for plain text document
preparation, task management and note taking, its also (subjectively) a much
better markup syntax. for these reasons writing in markdown feels like a pain.
now I am not stuck with it, projects like firn and ox-hugo exist and do work
very well. but those take time to set up and for the latter its not an
abstraction I like all to much (at least from a glance). these are again fixable
over time but require said investment of time...

## I tell myself I will come back to stuff later (and never do)

Now less on the tools and more on the user.
I have a bad habit of starting things and not finishing them. I currently have
4 drafts of articles, some have been sitting for months if not years. This is
not even discussing the idea's sitting in my agenda and rotting. The backlog
acts as a mental barrier "why start a new article when I have so many to
finish" or so my thoughts go. Of course I could finish all of the ones of value
but that requires time...

## I lack confidence in my writing

part of a broader theme within my character is that I lack confidence in what I
write, What I mean by this is I dislike sharing what I have written for after I
find all the mistakes and what not, this feeds into the lack of motivation which
can only be fixed with more writing, making mistakes and getting feedback,
feedback I can't get without sharing, this leads to demotivations in me writing
and the cycle continues

## Time and motivation

All of these have the common thread of time, time to fix the tools, time to use
a better markup language, time to improve my writing. so on. all of these could
be fixed with time. The thing is I do have time. if i planned out my time better
I would have enough time to write every week but no. this is not only a problem
of time but of motivation. If I don't have fun, if I don't enjoy the tools, If I
have these (artificial) mental blocks its obvious to anyone why they would not
engage with something

## Well then what happens now?

well for me I think I need to spend some time working on making my blog
something I like looking at and using. something I have fun writing in,
something that keeps me learning. this will take time, time I am
willing to spend if it means I can write more about the things I actually care
about.
