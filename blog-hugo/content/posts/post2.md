# Roasting Vegetables is great!

its a great way to get rid of those lingering vegetables and its simple and
quick to do! I see it as a fridge cleaner and an easy way to make a simple side.
(but i end up eating them on its own!)

## Prerequisites

There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to this. But i like to add in

- **At least one onion like vegetables.**
  This can be any sort of onion. I like the red flavour that comes with red but
  white oinions, shallots anything of that sort adds some real bite

- **Some sort of starchy plant**
  your roasting food so you might as well stick a potatoes in there and get some
  fries in your salad. sweet potatoes and yams would also work

- **Some kind of skin plant** when I say skin plant I mean a plant with a waxy
  skin the best example i can think of is a bell pepper. it adds bite and the
  high water content keeps it soft. it can add in some nice texture variance

- **A root vegetables** Carrots, turnips, parsnips, Swedes. these are probably
  the biggest offenders of the prison of your fridge we call the vegetable
  crisper. I say off with there heads! these brown up really nice and can add in
  a sweetness usually associated with these vegetables
- **Anything else you may have** most vegetables seem to do well in the oven so
  if its sitting there then you could probably stick it in. Mushrooms are some
  of my favorite things to add onto the tray but if its sitting there then go
  for it. This is not a universal rule and provides a segue into

### Stuff you probably should not add

I would recommend not roasting any sort of
[brassica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassica) as they usually release a lot
of water under heat and it will make your roast sad. I find they work great
for soups and stews. Another dish I will probably cover. Any sort of watery vegetable would probably have a similar affect. an
exception to this would probably be tomatoes. Because of there quite robust
skin they get some really nice colour and they pick up a nice flavour when
grilled.

### Stuff to add in after

- **Some sort of acid.** I like to either use some sort of lemon or some vinegar
  as it cuts through some of that richness that the fat can provide. I do not
  recommend using industrial grade acids as that is not safe, but if you do have
  industrial grade acid I question that you would need this disclaimer

- **Salt** Its the universal spice. I like it course and flaky for a bit more
  heterogeneity but table salt would also work but you would probably have to
  pre mix it

- **A fat** I like a melting fat such as butter or ghee but I have also done
  this with olive oil and that works really quite well! any sort of oil or fat
  could and should work. use what you like and more importantly have on hand.

You could also do some herbs and stuff. Go wild and give it a go!

## Cooking them.

This is not meant to be a pretty dish so get out a tray, hack up the veg and
stick it on the tray and whack it in the oven at around 200°C or 392°F and keep
and eye on it Taking out to stir once in a while. once its brown and cooked then
you should be good to eat. test any hard vegetables for done-ness and eat!

If you plan on cooking thick cut potatoes then i recommend par boiling them to
get the inside cooked. That can leave you with a really nice crust and a soft
inside.

I don't peel my vegetables as I like the flavor contrast the skins add but you
can peel them. you may need to dry your vegetables afterwards though as moisture
inhibits browning
