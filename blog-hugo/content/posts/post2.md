## Compiling emacs is not all that bad...
Emacs is one of those things that you can use for a lifetime. But you can't use
the same version for a lifetime. One day you will have to upgrade your version.
Whether that be because of nessity or curoisity is not up to me. I am just  guy
who wants to make this ordeal go a heck of a lot faster

## Prereqisites

To compile emacs you will need...

- a set of build tools. This will include
  - make
  - the gcc compiler (or any c compiler)
  - libc6 
  - git
  - the gnu coreutils
  - autoconf and automake
  
On debian based systems this is as easy as a `sudo apt install build-essential`
I don't really use any other systems you will need to install them but If you
know the packages [mail me!](mailto:jeetelongname@gmail.com) 
We also need some dependency's

- GNU tls
