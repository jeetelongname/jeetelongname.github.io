# My evolution of the Grilled cheese.

So I was making a grilled cheese and had the fun idea of adding ham. I had made
a croque monsieur but more importantly I had made my breakfast at 3pm. My mum ,who
has come home from work by now, had the idea of adding onions and chillies to
it. This sounded a lot like a hot-dog but i like hot-dogs so I preceded to try
and make it here is my recipe

# Ingredient's

Weights and measures prepare to be ignored!

- **Bread. Two slices per sandwich**
  Any kind will do but I prefer white baguette or tiger bread. the crust is
  crunchy by default and its just a blank canvas. but any bread will do.
- **Butter. Enough to cover two sides of bread** Margarine also works really
  well
- [**Cheese**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC3CjYCGEro) I use edam but any
  smooth melting cheese (cheddar, processed, gouda) will work fine.
- **Ham** Whatever you have to hand. Meat substitutes should also work

# Method

1. Slather the butter onto the bread. It should be T H I C C. the butter will
   brown the bread and soak into it making it soft and lovely.
2. In a cold pan place half the buttered bread, butter side down, and turn on
   the burner some of the butter will melt out as
3. Put on the Cheese, Ham, Onions and the other slice of bread ,butter side up,
   into the bread and try to flip the sandwich
