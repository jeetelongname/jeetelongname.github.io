** 2am paella :cooking:cheap:easy:

*** Introduction
Its 2am and your hungry, but you look in the noodle cupboard and you realise
your out of instant ramen ðŸ˜±.
#+hugo: more
Here is a quick way to eat some vegetables, prep some soul
filling food and have nummies done in 20ish minutes (which is not bad for something
from scratch). This is not a traditional recipe, It kinda is similar but its not
authentic in any way, shape or form.

**** The things you will use
***** Ingredience
- rice, about a cup :: this is the base and pretty non negotiable, pasta may work in a
  pinch but it will throw off some ratios and be harder to manage.
- vegetables :: this can be anything, except maybe lettuce, here is what I
  used.
  - mushrooms of some kind.
  - an onion, I use spring onions as it also work as a garnish.
  - bell peppers
  - and sweet potatoes but again anything will work.
- spices :: I used turmeric, chilli flakes garlic and garam marsala as that's what i had
  on hand but if you had some harisa powder it would work really well here. But
  play with the flavours. Its a blank canvas.
- protein :: now this is kinda optional as the things mentioned before would
  work wonders on its own but if you have chicken pieces or something
  similar tossing them in will not hurt. That being said if you do I would try
  and keep the skin (if there is any) above the water line to help browning
  later.

***** utensils
- chopping board and knife
- serving dish :: i.e plate
- oven safe pan :: this is because we will stick it under the broiler but if you
  don't have one then this dish will still be good without broiling the top.
**** the basic method
0. preheat the broiler
1. add some oil to a pan and start to fry your protein.
   this is to give it a head start and prevent some nasty smells (boiling
   unbrowned meat smells like corpses).
2. start prepping your veg. you can do this before but this saves on a little
   time. Cut them into manageable pieces, they don't need to be clean or even as
   it will all be boiled till tender.
3. add the veg into the pan and fry it all together.
4. add in rice to toast as well as the spices before, fry till they are fragrant.
5. add water to the pan and boil till rice is soft, keep topping the water up as needed.
   - While its boiling you can basically wash up the chopping board.
6. once rice is cooked, turn off the heat and put the pan under the hot broiler,
   cook until the top is brown (this will happen quick so watch it closely).
7. eat. Optionally garnish with something green, green bit on spring onions, coriander leaves
   go nuts!

*** Finishing thoughts
This is a fun little dish that acts as a blank canvas. chuck in whatever you
have and let it simmer for a bit and your done!

I _have_ been meaning to move over to using org for my blogging and ox-hugo is a

markdown, for anything non trivial its kinda a pain and I would rather be in org
** TODO The privacy of public transport
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: privacy_public_transport
:EXPORT_DATE: 2022-04-13
:END:
We as a world need to pick up public transport. Not only are they usually leagues
better for the environment compared to cars they are also more space efficient
and lead to quieter, safer and nicer cities.

But this comes at the cost of a few things (some of which can be fixed with
funding and time) but one of them seems almost un refutable. The idea of privacy
on transport. Now while in a theoretical sense this is true you are essentially
in a crowed of people any of which could approach you, in practice its one of
the more private experiences I have had.

*** The Car
The car is meant to be the epitome of freedom and privacy, go wherever you want
with no need to interact with people. But in this case there is the lack of
something. Either you are the driver in which case you are not free to do things
like work, read or sleep and in a sense the time is wasted driving. Or you are
a passenger in which case you are also not free (unless you are being driven
around which is out of the reach of 90% of the population). You are attached to
the social graces that come with human interaction in a confined space or are in
an even more mundane situation where you are the navigator or other auxiliary
function within the journey.

In either sense your not free to use that time in
some kind of productive manner and this will only get worse with more people in
this confined space, I say this as someone who has had one to many packed road
trips and dead butt cheeks.

*** Public Transport
With public transport I don't have this to worry about. When I am travelling
alone (which is most of the time). I am free to do what I want. I usually read
but am free to do some light work, free to rest to some degree as well. In reality I do
not have to talk to people other than the bus driver or odd ticket collector.
Other people are not a problem as they don't want to talk to me as much as I
don't want to talk to them. This is much more private and much more free,
especially with the ability to buy tickets on my phone the amount of interaction
with other human life goes down to near zero. And the interaction that does
happen is quick or pleasant enough that I enjoy it.

This being said this is not a blanket privacy, you can't break down on a train
the same way you can in a car, nor could you use a train as a home when camping
or when times are tough. Its not a private compartment but it is a nice social
interaction bubble which in a lot of contexts is all people need.

*** Conclusion
Public Transport is similar to a cafe. When you sit down at a table even though
you are in a crowd you are alone, and unless you are being loud or (for lack of
a better term) /weird/ then you are left alone for the most part. This privacy
in public in a way is freeing and something that becomes a nice to use after a
while.

:END:
Pacific Rim is one of my favorite movies, not because it says something deep
about society, or the human soul, not because its even that well made. But
because its a direct, witty, campy movie that opens up my inner 9 year old in
more ways than one. Its a deeply fun and interesting movie that almost forces
you back to being that child that loves the carnal pleasure of citys being
destroyed by biggest baddest robot fighting the biggest baddest robots.

*** The babble
and boy does this movie have a lot. Its a massive word soup that is thrown at
you hot and fast.
#+begin_quote
Solid iron hull, no alloys.
Forty engine blocks per muscle strand.
Hyper-torque driver for every limb
and a new fluid synapse system.
#+end_quote
This almost forces you to just let your mind run wild, there is nothing to
compare it against so we are forced to run with the discriptors, we start going
to bigger numbers cooler words and in essence, we dumb down our thought. This
does not stop mind you. We are bombarded with it throughout the movie. It is
never meant to be focused on, this is not a technical movie that wants to build
a technical world. but its use makes us

:END:
I recently, like a lot of people, watched the new Dr Strange movie. I found
it... underwhelming to say the least. Even though it looked great I left that
movie hall feeling like I just watched an underused mess. It was almost not as
fun as having to deal with the ire of my family, as I was the one who chose the
movie...

BTW this is an adaptation from a long discord message I posted in the [[https://doomemacs.org/discord][doom emacs
discord server]] so... Hi Legion! I guess.

***** *Spoilers ahead, you have been warned*

*** The movie
In a word felt like an underused cobbled together mess.
I watched it in 2D, this meant that I did not get the face punching 3d affects
and most of the spectacle of the story was squarely on the story (though the
movie still looked great). I think with better writing not only would the themes
and concepts have felt more solid but we would have more use (and proper use) of
characters.

The villain introduction relied on you watching Wanda Vision for the arc to make
sense, otherwise if your a casual, coming straight from endgame it felt very
much out of left field,

Characters that were teased at in the first Dr Strange, principally Mordo, A
character who was teased as the villain for the sequel was not even shown, we
instead get a Mordo that is not the one that has been built up and is then
thrown away after a mild fist fight with little resolution to what he means to
Strange. This lack of continuity from its principal prequel felt like a pressure
release valve going off, All bets are off and all tension is cut, This will not
translate over to any third movie as it would have been too long, The first
movie was release in 2016... 6 years ago. another movie will not be coming for a
while and by that time at least my psyche would have moved on. Mordo and his
build up would have been wasted.

The Illuminati (why the illuminati??) present in universe 838 was comprised of the
first cannon introductions of both the Fantastic Four and the Xmen in the MCU
(M?) both of which were over very quickly on screen, it felt like "oh this is a
thing that will be coming in the later movies but we want to tease it now". Then
you also have Peggy Carter as Captain Britain (or whatever), principally a call
back to What If but if you did not watch that, it was a gag. A lesser example of
the problem I had with Wanda's arc.

*** Themes from a box

Themes are presented such as happiness, motherhood, loss and confidence.
none of these felt explored in any satisfactory way.
Happiness was not really dealt with, Strange was just kinda asked "are you
happy?" and lied through his teeth, this then came up near the end as well when
evil Strange number 3 asked the same question and then they started fighting
with music notes. It was kinda resolved with the monologue to 838 Christine but
in a cheesy way, not in anything that felt good for the character. It felt like
the cliche line and a cliche theme that did not do much for our character. I
feel like the movie would not have been different if it was not included.

Motherhood was better in this regard. It gave Wanda's sacrifice weight in a
sense and was played in little bits though out the movie, as she dreamed and dream
walked, It added to her ending seeing her actions come to ahead and see how she
will never be a mother to any child she abducts, it was a good scene and a good
theme.

Confidence on the other hand while being intertwined with happyness also takes a
lot of traits from it (not really but the parralels are there). it did not feel
dealt with in any real sense thoughout the movie and it just came to the head
that was the power of friendship ending where the protagonist learns to believe
in themselves and then girlbosses scarlet witch. It felt rushed with no real
build up.

*** Multiverse of... not much?

The concept of multiverse was very much underused with us not getting a chance
to really see it. This does not mean I want to see a massive amount of
universies but want to see /the concept/. otherwise it does not become a
distinct thing, a concept the movie plays with. but a plot device that does
nothing but give our characters reason to move, as well as fuel this power of
love story ending (I know its not actually a power of love ending, I am taking a
little bit of piss)
some may say It was never explained in any real way which reflects
the unknown nature of it to our protagonists, but even still with this it does
not feel distinct in any meaningful way
*** What this says about the MCU

This speaks to a bigger problem I saw in endgame but think this movie
exemplifies, The MCU has gotten too big to be cohesive. most of the movie felt
like callbacks, teasers and set up with actual substance being lost. It leads to
a movie that felt hollow in many senses, gravity has been lost and points of
interest have become little more than lore points for the overall arc in
phase 5. As it grows if you want to stay in the loop and understand most movies
fully, you need to watch everything that comes before, its getting to the point
where there are entire sub markets writing up plot summaries so that you can
understand the movie. This essentially excludes the casual from the franchises
they enjoy, People may only tune in for the movies they care about (for me those
being the spiderman and Dr Strange and maybe Thor) they are left out. Now I
could go on about how this is all to drive up profit and coerce people into
going to every movie and watching all the shows on disney+ but that's for another
day.

Part of the magic of the first set of movies was that it was a small rag tag
team that had there own introductions, each movie added context but also did not
become required reading to understand in full.

Endgame was the beginning of this, This movie is the beginning of the end.
