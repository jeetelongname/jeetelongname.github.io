## Hi I am Jeet!

I am a Student that is studying computer science
This is my Blog!

Hopefully when I do get the time Ill write up some of my recipies and include
more of my thoughts.

## Thats well and good but whats it about?

I use Linux, and I cook, this is what I will write about when I find the time.
I am constantly experimenting with new pieces of software and will probably
write about them at some point.
