<p>Its 2am and your hungry, but you look in the noodle cupboard and you realise

Ingredience
</h6>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-6">
<dl>
<dt>
rice, about a cup
</dt>
<dd>this is the base and pretty non negotiable, pasta may work in a
pinch but it will throw off some ratios and be harder to manage.</dd>
<dt>
vegetables
</dt>
<dd>
<p>this can be anything, except maybe lettuce, here is what I
used.</p>
<ul>
<li>mushrooms of some kind.</li>
<li>an onion, I use spring onions as it also work as a garnish.</li>
<li>bell peppers</li>
<li>and sweet potatoes but again anything will work.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>
spices
</dt>
<dd>I used turmeric, chilli flakes garlic and garam marsala as that&#39;s what i had
on hand but if you had some harisa powder it would work really well here. But
play with the flavours. Its a blank canvas.</dd>
<dt>
protein
</dt>
<dd>now this is kinda optional as the things mentioned before would
work wonders on its own but if you have chicken pieces or something
similar tossing them in will not hurt. That being said if you do I would try
and keep the skin (if there is any) above the water line to help browning
later.</dd>

the basic method
</h5>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-5">
<ol>
<li>preheat the broiler</li>
<li>add some oil to a pan and start to fry your protein.
this is to give it a head start and prevent some nasty smells (boiling
unbrowned meat smells like corpses).</li>
<li>start prepping your veg. you can do this before but this saves on a little
time. Cut them into manageable pieces, they don&#39;t need to be clean or even as
it will all be boiled till tender.</li>
<li>add the veg into the pan and fry it all together.</li>
<li>add in rice to toast as well as the spices before, fry till they are fragrant.</li>
<li>
<p>add water to the pan and boil till rice is soft, keep topping the water up as needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>While its boiling you can basically wash up the chopping board.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>once rice is cooked, turn off the heat and put the pan under the hot broiler,
cook until the top is brown (this will happen quick so watch it closely).</li>
<li>eat. Optionally garnish with something green, green bit on spring onions, coriander leaves
go nuts!</li>

The privacy of public transport
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-3">
<p>We as a world need to pick up public transport. Not only are they usually leagues
better for the environment compared to cars they are also more space efficient
and lead to quieter, safer and nicer cities.</p>
<p>
But this comes at the cost of a few things (some of which can be fixed with
funding and time) but one of them seems almost un refutable. The idea of privacy
on transport. Now while in a theoretical sense this is true you are essentially
in a crowed of people any of which could approach you, in practice its one of
the more private experiences I have had.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-12" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-12">
The Car
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-12" class="outline-text-4">
<p>The car is meant to be the epitome of freedom and privacy, go wherever you want
with no need to interact with people. But in this case there is the lack of
something. Either you are the driver in which case you are not free to do things
like work, read or sleep and in a sense the time is wasted driving. Or you are
a passenger in which case you are also not free (unless you are being driven
around which is out of the reach of 90% of the population). You are attached to
the social graces that come with human interaction in a confined space or are in
an even more mundane situation where you are the navigator or other auxiliary
function within the journey.</p>
<p>
In either sense your not free to use that time in
some kind of productive manner and this will only get worse with more people in
this confined space, I say this as someone who has had one to many packed road
trips and dead butt cheeks.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-13" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-13">
Public Transport
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-13" class="outline-text-4">
<p>With public transport I don&#39;t have this to worry about. When I am travelling
alone (which is most of the time). I am free to do what I want. I usually read
but am free to do some light work, free to rest to some degree as well. In reality I do
not have to talk to people other than the bus driver or odd ticket collector.
Other people are not a problem as they don&#39;t want to talk to me as much as I
don&#39;t want to talk to them. This is much more private and much more free,
especially with the ability to buy tickets on my phone the amount of interaction
with other human life goes down to near zero. And the interaction that does
happen is quick or pleasant enough that I enjoy it.</p>
<p>
This being said this is not a blanket privacy, you can&#39;t break down on a train
the same way you can in a car, nor could you use a train as a home when camping
or when times are tough. Its not a private compartment but it is a nice social
interaction bubble which in a lot of contexts is all people need.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-14" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-14">
Conclusion
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-14" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Public Transport is similar to a cafe. When you sit down at a table even though
you are in a crowd you are alone, and unless you are being loud or (for lack of
a better term) <em>weird</em> then you are left alone for the most part. This privacy
in public in a way is freeing and something that becomes a nice to use after a
while.</p>

</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-17" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Pacific Rim is one of my favorite movies, not because it says something deep
about society, or the human soul, not because its even that well made. But
because its a direct, witty, campy movie that opens up my inner 9 year old in
more ways than one. Its a deeply fun and interesting movie that almost forces
you back to being that child that loves the carnal pleasure of citys being
destroyed by biggest baddest robot fighting the biggest baddest robots.</p>

<p>Solid iron hull, no alloys.
Forty engine blocks per muscle strand.

<p>This almost forces you to just let your mind run wild, there is nothing to
compare it against so we are forced to run with the discriptors, we start going
to bigger numbers cooler words and in essence, we dumb down our thought. This
does not stop mind you. We are bombarded with it throughout the movie. It is
never meant to be focused on, this is not a technical movie that wants to build
a technical world. but its use makes us</p>

<div id="outline-text-headline-22" class="outline-text-3">
<p>I recently, like a lot of people, watched the new Dr Strange movie. I found
itâ€¦ underwhelming to say the least. Even though it looked great I left that
movie hall feeling like I just watched an underused mess. It was almost not as
fun as having to deal with the ire of my family, as I was the one who chose the
movieâ€¦</p>

<h4 id="headline-24">
The movie
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-24" class="outline-text-4">
<p>In a word it felt like an underused cobbled together mess.
I watched it in 2D, this meant that I did not get the face punching 3d affects
and most of the spectacle of the story was squarely on the story (though the
movie still looked great). I think with better writing not only would the themes
and concepts have felt more solid but we would have more use (and proper use) of
characters.</p>
<p>
The villain introduction relied on you watching Wanda Vision for the arc to make
sense, otherwise if you are a casual, coming straight from endgame it felt very
much out of left field.</p>
<p>
Characters that were teased at in the first Dr Strange, principally Mordo, a
character who was teased as the villain for the sequel was not even shown. We
instead get a Mordo that is not the one that has been built up and is then
thrown away after a mild fist fight with little resolution to what he means to
Strange. This lack of continuity from its principal prequel felt like a pressure
release valve going off. All bets are off and all tension is cut. This will not
translate over to any third movie as it would have been too long. the first
movie was released in 2016â€¦ 6 years ago. another movie will not be coming for a
while and by that time at least my psyche would have moved on. Mordo and his
build up would have been wasted.</p>
<p>
The Illuminati (why the illuminati??) present in universe 838 were comprised of the
first cannon introductions of both the Fantastic Four and the Xmen in the MCU
(M?) both of which were over very quickly on screen, it felt like &#34;oh this is a
thing that will be coming in the later movies but we want to tease it now&#34;. Then
you also have Peggy Carter as Captain Britain (or whatever), principally a call
back to What If but if you did not watch that, it was a gag. A lesser example of
the problem I had with Wanda&#39;s arc.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-25" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-25">
Themes from a box
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-25" class="outline-text-4">
<p>
Themes are presented such as happiness, motherhood, loss and confidence.
None of these felt explored in any satisfactory way.
Happiness was not really dealt with, Strange was just kinda asked &#34;are you
happy?&#34; and lied through his teeth, this then came up near the end as well when
evil Strange number 3 asked the same question and then they started fighting
with music notes. It was kinda resolved with the monologue to 838 Christine but
in a cheesy way, not in anything that felt good for the character. It felt like
the cliche line and a cliche theme that did not do much for our character. I
feel like the movie would not have been different if it was not included.</p>
<p>
Motherhood was better in this regard. It gave Wanda&#39;s sacrifice weight in a
sense and was played in little bits though out the movie, as she dreamed and dream
walked. It added to her ending seeing her actions come to a head and see how she
will never be a mother to any child she abducts. It was a good scene and a good
theme.</p>
<p>
Confidence on the other hand while being intertwined with happiness also takes a
lot of traits from it (not really but the parallels are there). it did not feel
dealt with in any real sense though out the movie and it just came to the head
that was the power of friendship ending where the protagonist learns to believe
in themselves and then girlbosses scarlet witch. It felt rushed with no real
build up.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-26" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-26">
Multiverse ofâ€¦ not much?
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-26" class="outline-text-4">
<p>
The concept of multiverse was very much underused with us not getting a chance
to really see it. This does not mean I want to see a massive amount of
universes but want to see <em>the concept</em>. Otherwise it does not become a
distinct thing, a concept the movie plays with, but a plot device that does
nothing but give our characters reason to move (editor&#39;s note: a MacGuffin
(Thanks Lejon)), as well as fuel this power of
love story ending (I know its not actually a power of love ending, I am taking a
little bit of piss)
Some may say It was never explained in any real way which reflects
the unknown nature of it to our protagonists, but even still with this it does
not feel distinct in any meaningful way</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-headline-27" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-27">
What this says about the MCU
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-27" class="outline-text-4">
<p>
This speaks to a bigger problem I saw in endgame but think this movie
exemplifies, The MCU has gotten too big to be cohesive. Most of the movie felt
like callbacks, teasers and set up with actual substance being lost. It leads to
a movie that felt hollow in many senses, gravity has been lost and points of
interest have become little more than lore points for the overall arc in
phase 5. As it grows if you want to stay in the loop and understand most movies
fully, you need to watch everything that comes before, its getting to the point
where there are entire sub markets writing up plot summaries so that you can
understand the movie. This essentially excludes the casual from the franchises
they enjoy, People may only tune in for the movies they care about (for me those
being the spiderman and Dr Strange and maybe Thor) they are left out. Now I
could go on about how this is all to drive up profit and coerce people into
going to every movie and watching all the shows on Disney+ but that&#39;s for another
day.</p>
<p>
Part of the magic of the first set of movies was that it was a small rag tag
team that had there own introductions, each movie added context but also did not
become required reading to understand in full.</p>
<p>
Endgame was the beginning of this. This movie is the beginning of the end.</p>

Moving to wayland! Login shell lambasting

<div id="outline-container-headline-29" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-29">
The problem
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-29" class="outline-text-4">
<p>I have been trying to move to wayland for the past year. The call of gestures,
less artifacting and just the <em>hype</em> had me spell bound. The problem was,
GNOME, my DE of choice, decided to make what I think is the asinine choice to not
start the DE in a login shell. All this meant was my <code>.profile</code> never runs and my nix
environment never get set up. This is a deal breaker for me because I have
programs I use every day (principally emacs) which I can now not access.</p>
<p>
This is not a problem though! GNOME has thought of everything! you can now
<em>declarativly</em> declare all the environment variables you want with an
<code>environment.d/*.conf</code> file! Oh wait. I can&#39;t run shell scripts with thatâ€¦ Thats
the reason nix &#34;broke&#34;, it sets its environment using a set of external shell
scripts that can and do change as nix installs and removes packages. This is not
a problem for a login shell as it just runs them like any normal sourced file.
but you can&#39;t run scripts in this conf file meaning nix stays broken.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-30" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-30">
What was my solutions?
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-30" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Well my first port of call was of course to force gnome to start a wayland
session in a login shell. After all thats how other people get other wayland
environments to respect there <code>.profiles</code>. Ez slap a <code>-l</code> in the exec call of
whatever program starts gnome and we are golden rightâ€¦ Well no. While you can
wiggle it into running a login shell, it seems its allergic to running in a
wayland session. I am not sure of the black magic GNOME does to start its
wayland session but its above my pay grade.
That being said I have tried most things from fiddling with the xsession file to
pass in a <code>-l</code> argument too making my own slighlty modified <code>gnome-session</code>
start up script. They either did not spawn a wayland session, or did not load my
<code>.profile</code> (or in one entertaining case did not launch GNOME at all, I just had
a bare x display server). In any sense it did not work and it made me sad.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-31" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="headline-31">
The actual solution
</h5>
<div id="outline-text-headline-31" class="outline-text-5">
<p>But thanks to Flat on the doom emacs discord server, for breaking me out of the
rut I was in. and inspration from the <a href="https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs">doom env command for some inspiration</a>
Instead of trying to force GNOME into the login shell, bring my login shell (its
environment) to GNOME!</p>
<p>
This is where I ask you to flash back too 20 seconds ago
where I mentioned the <code>environment.d/*.conf</code>. Well all we are doing is setting
environment variables, if we could capture all of the environment variables my
<code>.profile</code> sets and pipe that into a conf file We would be done!
In a nice list it would take three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>a command to print all the set environment variables</li>
<li>A command to run my .profile</li>
<li>an empty environment to actually see <em>exactly</em> what is being set</li>
</ul>
<p>the first and last are actually handled by the <code>env</code> command! Which makes my life
easier. Just call it with the <code>-i</code> flag and it starts with and empty
environment! Then call it at the end to get my list! Now to read my .profile.
Turns out we can just call <code>sh</code> with the <code>-l</code> flag like I have been wanting to
do with GNOME! This leads to this very nice one liner which I can then redirect
into a <code>.conf</code> file like so.</p>
<div class="src src-shell">
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">env -i HOME=/home/jeet sh -l -c env &gt; ~/.config/environment.d/profile.conf</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>
I don&#39;t even have to do any parsing as its already in the syntax the
<code>environment.d</code> expects!
And that was it! Just that one liner and a log out and I can finally use Wayland!
Its such a simple hack in retrospect. All I would need to do now is hook this
into running at the tail end of a nix update to recapture my environment and
this hack would be seemless!</p>

Conclusion
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-32" class="outline-text-4">
<p>The fact I have had to do this in the first place feels silly. I love GNOME and
I can understand why the devs would want to move to a more intergrated system in
a sense. Does not stop me from being mad I had to wait a year to be able to use
Wayland full time. Or that I have had to spend so much time trying to figure out
how to wiggle <em>my not unpopular use case</em> into something usable. In any case the fix is
there and I can move onto bigger things! This may be the beginning of a set of
posts about Wayland and my adaptations to it so stay tuned!</p>
