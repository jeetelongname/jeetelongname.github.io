	<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>I have been trying to move to Wayland for the past year. The call of gestures,
less artifacting and just the <em>hype</em> had me spell bound. The problem was,
GNOME, my DE of choice, decided to make what I think is the asinine choice to not
start the DE in a login shell. All this meant was my <code>.profile</code> never runs and my nix
environment never get set up. This is a deal breaker for me because I have
programs I use every day (principally emacs) which I can now not access.</p>
<p>This is not a problem though! GNOME has thought of everything! you can now
<em>declarativly</em> declare all the environment variables you want with an
<code>environment.d/*.conf</code> file!.. Oh wait. I can&rsquo;t run shell scripts with that&hellip;
That&rsquo;s
the reason I could not use my nix programs, nix sets its environment using a set of external shell
scripts that can and do change as nix installs and removes packages. This is not
a problem for a login shell as it just runs them like any normal sourced file.
But you can&rsquo;t run scripts in this conf file meaning nix stays unusable.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-my-solution-then">What was my solution then?</h2>
<p>Well my first port of call was of course to force GNOME to start a Wayland
session in a login shell. After all thats how other people get other Wayland
environments to respect there <code>.profiles</code>. Ez slap a <code>-l</code> in the exec call of
whatever program starts GNOME and we are golden right&hellip; Well no. While you can
wiggle GNOME into running a login shell, it seems its allergic to running in a
Wayland session. I am not sure of the black magic GNOME does to start its
Wayland session but its above my pay grade.
That being said I have tried most things from fiddling with the xsession file to
pass in a <code>-l</code> argument too making my own slightly modified <code>gnome-session</code>
start up script. They either did not spawn a Wayland session, or did not load my
<code>.profile</code> (or in one entertaining case did not launch GNOME at all, I just had
a bare x display server). In any sense it did not work and it made me sad.</p>
<h3 id="the-actual-solution">The actual solution</h3>
<p>But thanks to Flat on the doom emacs discord server, for breaking me out of the
rut I was in, and inspiration from the <a href="https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs">doom env command</a>
Instead of trying to force GNOME into the login shell, bring my login shell
(more specifically my environment) to GNOME!</p>
<p>This is where I ask you to flash back too 20 seconds ago
where I mentioned the <code>environment.d/*.conf</code> files. Well all we are doing is setting
environment variables with our <code>.profile</code>, if we could capture all of the
environment variables my <code>.profile</code> sets and pipe that into a conf file We would
be done! In a nice list it would take three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>an empty environment to actually see <em>exactly</em> what is being set</li>
<li>A command to run my .profile</li>
<li>a command to print all the set environment variables</li>
</ul>
<p>The first and last are actually handled by the <code>env</code> command!  Just call it with
the <code>-i</code> flag and it starts with and empty environment! Then call it at the end
to get my list! Now to read my .profile.
Turns out we can just call <code>sh</code> with the <code>-l</code> flag to start a login shell, lik I
have been wanting to do with GNOME! This leads to this very nice one liner which
I can then redirect into a <code>.conf</code> file like so.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">env -i HOME=/home/jeet sh -l -c env &gt; ~/.config/environment.d/profile.conf
</code></pre></div><p>I don&rsquo;t even have to do any parsing as its already in the syntax the
<code>environment.d</code> expects!
And that was it! Just that one liner and a log out and I can finally use Wayland!
Its such a simple hack in retrospect. All I would need to do now is hook this
into running at the tail end of a nix update to recapture my environment and
this hack would be seemless!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The fact I have had to do this in the first place feels silly. I love GNOME and
I can understand why the devs would want to move to a more intergrated system in
a sense. Does not stop me from being mad I had to wait a year to be able to use
Wayland full time. Or that I have had to spend so much time trying to figure out
how to wiggle <em>my not unpopular use case</em> into something usable. In any case the fix is
there, even if its not preferred, and I can move onto bigger things! This may be
the beginning of a set of posts about Wayland and my adaptations to it so stay tuned!</p>
<p>And if you did manage to actually get a GNOME Wayland session to start in a login
shell though please do reach out!</p>
