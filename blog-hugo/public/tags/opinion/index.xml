      <description>I recently, like a lot of people, watched the new Dr Strange movie. I found it&amp;hellip; underwhelming to say the least. Even though it looked great I left that movie hall feeling like I just watched an underused mess. It was almost not as fun as having to deal with the ire of my family, as I was the one who chose the movie&amp;hellip;
BTW this is an adaptation from a long discord message I posted in the doom emacs discord server so&amp;hellip; Hi Legion!</description>

      <description>This blog has been a bit quiet. I enjoy writing about things, I have many things to write about, but I never do. Why is that? This is a kind of rambling dive into some of the reasons I have noticed.
My tools I dislike the blogging system I have chosen. Hugo is a fine piece of work don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, but for me it feels incomplete in a certain sense.</description>
