      <description>I have been reading Dune and finished the first sub-book, its a wonderful book that has been somewhat spoiled for me in certain ways. Even still its a thoroughly interesting book. As a way to save space instead of typing up my thoughts directly into a discord post I am going to type it into a blog post. This will be shorter, less structured and somewhat akin to a conversation I am having by myself.</description>

      <description>I recently, like a lot of people, watched the new Dr Strange movie. I found it&amp;hellip; underwhelming to say the least. Even though it looked great I left that movie hall feeling like I just watched an underused mess. It was almost not as fun as having to deal with the ire of my family, as I was the one who chose the movie&amp;hellip;
BTW this is an adaptation from a long discord message I posted in the doom emacs discord server so&amp;hellip; Hi Lejon!</description>
