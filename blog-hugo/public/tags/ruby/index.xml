      <description>It all started from a joke.. A friend sent me a code snippet in an effort to prank meme. To bad for him I know that url by heart and was not fooled by his petty gambit. But this got me thinking about ways of shrinking his solution and ended up with me finding different ways to manipulate the same list into doing the same thing. I hope you find this journey as interesting as I did!</description>
