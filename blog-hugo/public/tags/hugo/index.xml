      <description>This blog has been a bit quiet. I enjoy writing about things, I have many things to write about, but I never do. Why is that? This is a kind of rambling dive into some of the reasons I have noticed.
My tools I dislike the blogging system I have chosen. Hugo is a fine piece of work don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, but for me it feels incomplete in a certain sense.</description>

      <description>I am no expert I should start this by saying I started this website a good year ago and did nothing with it. I was adamant that I would do everything in wrought HTML ,lets just say that was a massive mistake. I ended up settling on a simple home page with a hugo blog to power the back-end. After multiple hiccups with finding a theme i had settled on Tokiwa for a while and all was well&amp;hellip; that was until i tried blogging.</description>
