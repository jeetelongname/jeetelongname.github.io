      <description>I have been reading Dune and finished the first sub-book, its a wonderful book that has been somewhat spoiled for me in certain ways. Even still its a thoroughly interesting book. As a way to save space instead of typing up my thoughts directly into a discord post I am going to type it into a blog post. This will be shorter, less structured and somewhat akin to a conversation I am having by myself.</description>
