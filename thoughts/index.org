This is my microblog, Its just for small thoughs no more than a paragraph or so.
Kinda like twitter but just for me :) Press =?= for keybinds, there are some neat
ones.

* CD to the last working directory
cd can /cd/ to the last working directory using a =-= in it. pretty neat if your
moving between projects.
I also learned that [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html][eshell]] takes this up a notch. You can use ~cd =~
to get a stack of all the directories you have visited as well as there place in
the stack. You can then jump to these using =cd -<number>= pretty neat
