            I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as
            Object oriented programming, is in fact, many paradigm/Oop , or as
            I've recently taken to calling it, many paradigm + oop. Oop is not
            an programming language unto itself, but rather another  component
            of a fully functioning programming language made useful by virtues of
            functional programming, flow control  and vital system structure
            comprising a full programming
            as defined by a language specification
            <br>
            Many developers run a modified by version of Oop every day, without
            realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of
            multi paradigm which is widely used today is often called oop, and
            many of its users are not aware that it is basically a flexible and
            general use language, developed by the language designers.
            <br>
            There really is an oop, and these people are using it, but it is just
            a part of the programming  language they use. Oop the paradigm in
            the programming language that allows for many reproudacble and manipulatable
            structures. Oop is an essential part of a programming language, but
            useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete
            programming language. Oop is normally used in combination with the
            rest of a programming
            language: the whole language is basically multi paradigm with oop
            added, or multi paradigm. All the so-called Oop languages are really
            multi paradigm languages
