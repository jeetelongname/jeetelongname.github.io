        <p>
            I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Object oriented programming, is in fact, many paradigm/Oop , or as I've recently taken to calling it, many paradigm + oop. Oop is not an programming
            language unto itself, but rather another  component of a fully functioning programming language made useful by virtues of functional programming, flow control  and vital system structure comprising a full programming
            as defined by a language specification
            <br>
            Many developers run a modified by version of Oop every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of multi paradigm which is widely used today is often called oop, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically a flexible and general use language, developed by the language designers.
            <br>
            There really is an oop, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the programming  language they use. Oop the paradigm in the programming language that allows for many reproudacble and manipulatable
            structures. Oop is an essential part of a programming language, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete programming language. Oop is normally used in combination with the rest of a programming
            language: the whole language is basically multi paradigm with oop added, or multi paradigm. All the so-called Oop languages are really multi paradigm languages
